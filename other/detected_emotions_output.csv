"One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother.",0.183,0.276,0.917,0.483,0.945,0.052
"I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, Oh, why can't you remain like this for ever!",0.460,0.931,0.035,0.520,0.908,0.107
"This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up.",0.205,0.562,0.871,0.816,0.921,0.150
You always know after you are two.,0.867,0.109,0.062,0.364,0.797,0.352
Two is the beginning of the end.,0.147,0.424,0.110,0.961,0.108,0.019
"Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.",0.615,0.232,0.669,0.397,0.989,0.022
"She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.",0.888,0.169,0.770,0.536,0.866,0.209
"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.",0.567,0.819,0.952,0.967,0.686,0.296
"The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her.",0.130,0.467,0.578,0.881,0.961,0.124
"He got all of her, except the innermost box and the kiss.",0.084,0.317,0.862,0.406,0.078,0.176
"He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.",0.160,0.770,0.739,0.115,0.109,0.203
"Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door.",0.405,0.956,0.337,0.687,0.870,0.117
Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him.,0.144,0.715,0.632,0.108,0.580,0.124
He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.,0.022,0.072,0.962,0.845,0.589,0.260
"Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.",0.063,0.230,0.781,0.597,0.930,0.101
"Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.",0.273,0.690,0.484,0.869,0.875,0.474
She drew them when she should have been totting up.,0.497,0.440,0.135,0.421,0.147,0.098
They were Mrs. Darling's guesses.,0.098,0.293,0.104,0.457,0.990,0.137
"Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.",0.361,0.922,0.019,0.301,0.091,0.299
"For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed.",0.863,0.179,0.721,0.509,0.967,0.092
"Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darling's bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly.",0.247,0.721,0.680,0.929,0.994,0.012
"She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.",0.337,0.362,0.993,0.970,0.913,0.022
"Now don't interrupt, he would beg of her.",0.437,0.718,0.340,0.635,0.242,0.162
"I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can cut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven who is that moving?",0.068,0.351,0.972,0.988,0.928,0.018
"eight nine seven, dot and carry seven don't speak, my own and the pound you lent to that man who came to the door quiet, child dot and carry child there, you've done it!",0.145,0.787,0.814,0.870,0.377,0.227
did I say nine nine seven?,0.554,0.436,0.729,0.851,0.415,0.711
"yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on nine nine seven?",0.454,0.783,0.708,0.784,0.247,0.225
"Of course we can, George, she cried.",0.277,0.792,0.088,0.318,0.583,0.156
"But she was prejudiced in Wendy's favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.",0.169,0.377,0.910,0.888,0.952,0.198
"Remember mumps, he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went again.",0.701,0.956,0.332,0.502,0.138,0.102
"Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay it will be more like thirty shillings don't speak measles one five, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six don't waggle your finger whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings and so on it went, and it added up differently each time; but",0.178,0.651,0.877,0.927,0.950,0.082
"at last Wendy just got through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated as one.",0.543,0.956,0.885,0.789,0.984,0.014
"There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower squeak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of them going in a row to Miss Fulsom's Kindergarten school, accompanied by their nurse.",0.255,0.766,0.191,0.655,0.725,0.234
"Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse.",0.847,0.155,0.935,0.121,0.926,0.143
"As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her.",0.386,0.026,0.871,0.907,0.917,0.158
"She had always thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their mistresses.",0.140,0.520,0.829,0.923,0.944,0.307
She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse.,0.165,0.871,0.060,0.066,0.349,0.127
"How thorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry.",0.483,0.587,0.802,0.533,0.997,0.008
Of course her kennel was in the nursery.,0.412,0.681,0.357,0.458,0.923,0.279
She had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with and when it needs stocking around your throat.,0.612,0.442,0.818,0.972,0.644,0.127
"She believed to her last day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on.",0.747,0.682,0.482,0.744,0.814,0.092
"It was a lesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed.",0.669,0.308,0.945,0.445,0.944,0.100
"On John's footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain.",0.278,0.936,0.925,0.588,0.399,0.957
There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom's school where the nurses wait.,0.327,0.744,0.044,0.951,0.746,0.477
"They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference.",0.790,0.130,0.612,0.192,0.941,0.118
"They affected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and she despised their light talk.",0.073,0.734,0.462,0.429,0.119,0.038
"She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling's friends, but if they did come she first whipped off Michael's pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John's hair.",0.652,0.897,0.477,0.747,0.989,0.026
"No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.",0.359,0.597,0.926,0.691,0.293,0.294
He had his position in the city to consider.,0.213,0.913,0.950,0.244,0.033,0.241
Nana also troubled him in another way.,0.683,0.151,0.177,0.548,0.446,0.341
He had sometimes a feeling that she did not admire him.,0.047,0.586,0.716,0.341,0.698,0.213
"I know she admires you tremendously, George, Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father.",0.421,0.412,0.978,0.203,0.743,0.200
"Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join.",0.393,0.577,0.936,0.060,0.954,0.206
"Such a midget she looked in her long skirt and maid's cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that she would never see ten again.",0.267,0.368,0.530,0.930,0.168,0.050
The gaiety of those romps!,0.568,0.557,0.188,0.580,0.045,0.628
"And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it.",0.128,0.367,0.866,0.900,0.985,0.108
There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.,0.447,0.191,0.630,0.012,0.982,0.142
Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children's minds.,0.459,0.162,0.939,0.076,0.856,0.499
"It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.",0.829,0.885,0.940,0.969,0.595,0.162
"If you could keep awake (but of course you can't) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her.",0.141,0.829,0.776,0.413,0.644,0.069
It is quite like tidying up drawers.,0.654,0.645,0.904,0.482,0.813,0.236
"You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.",0.555,0.665,0.955,0.838,0.833,0.182
"When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.",0.423,0.903,0.807,0.804,0.982,0.023
I don't know whether you have ever seen a map of a person's mind.,0.585,0.706,0.456,0.284,0.070,0.629
"Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child's mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time.",0.625,0.648,0.255,0.859,0.918,0.230
"There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes",0.741,0.166,0.661,0.977,0.542,0.210
"who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.",0.327,0.800,0.738,0.797,0.759,0.080
"It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of",0.865,0.679,0.638,0.618,0.785,0.041
"the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.",0.236,0.717,0.518,0.876,0.896,0.239
Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal.,0.720,0.243,0.374,0.348,0.389,0.637
"John's, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it.",0.089,0.103,0.436,0.890,0.990,0.041
"John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together.",0.378,0.749,0.183,0.849,0.407,0.188
"John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other's nose, and so forth.",0.310,0.677,0.386,0.923,0.441,0.329
On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles.,0.706,0.248,0.053,0.542,0.995,0.014
"We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.",0.412,0.440,0.082,0.324,0.702,0.090
"Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed.",0.288,0.840,0.631,0.990,0.250,0.364
"When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real.",0.212,0.856,0.760,0.951,0.979,0.063
That is why there are night-lights.,0.260,0.911,0.970,0.677,0.939,0.074
"Occasionally in her travels through her children's minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter.",0.739,0.420,0.908,0.161,0.780,0.367
"She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael's minds, while Wendy's began to be scrawled all over with him.",0.111,0.751,0.598,0.539,0.840,0.493
"The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.",0.370,0.164,0.727,0.407,0.210,0.446
"Yes, he is rather cocky, Wendy admitted with regret.",0.392,0.853,0.293,0.598,0.283,0.374
Her mother had been questioning her.,0.247,0.508,0.056,0.712,0.130,0.263
"But who is he, my pet?",0.354,0.439,0.419,0.924,0.033,0.373
"He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.",0.403,0.325,0.397,0.298,0.036,0.276
"At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies.",0.674,0.193,0.427,0.497,0.979,0.175
"There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.",0.146,0.602,0.592,0.336,0.884,0.058
"She had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.",0.343,0.248,0.887,0.684,0.960,0.021
"Besides, she said to Wendy, he would be grown up by this time.",0.270,0.343,0.429,0.548,0.208,0.125
"Oh no, he isn't grown up, Wendy assured her confidently, and he is just my size.",0.196,0.853,0.045,0.772,0.063,0.173
"She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she didn't know how she knew, she just knew it.",0.051,0.921,0.453,0.733,0.531,0.218
"Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh.",0.769,0.840,0.938,0.467,0.563,0.412
"Mark my words, he said, it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have.",0.588,0.355,0.744,0.816,0.748,0.061
"Leave it alone, and it will blow over.",0.284,0.484,0.271,0.478,0.847,0.033
But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.,0.669,0.329,0.556,0.177,0.446,0.324
Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.,0.128,0.765,0.553,0.844,0.591,0.192
"For instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game with him.",0.170,0.077,0.597,0.832,0.959,0.123
It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquieting revelation.,0.219,0.498,0.504,0.322,0.959,0.424
"Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:",0.833,0.149,0.893,0.904,0.953,0.211
I do believe it is that Peter again!,0.582,0.334,0.316,0.509,0.746,0.060
"Whatever do you mean, Wendy?",0.017,0.768,0.037,0.694,0.156,0.023
"It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet, Wendy said, sighing.",0.523,0.762,0.828,0.767,0.065,0.297
She was a tidy child.,0.542,0.080,0.986,0.151,0.860,0.040
She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played on his pipes to her.,0.398,0.892,0.735,0.744,0.866,0.191
"Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn't know how she knew, she just knew.",0.116,0.961,0.421,0.821,0.074,0.091
"What nonsense you talk, precious.",0.405,0.736,0.549,0.278,0.704,0.105

"Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?",0.069,0.863,0.160,0.814,0.996,0.021
It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.,0.742,0.503,0.351,0.302,0.772,0.385

"My child, the mother cried, why did you not tell me of this before?",0.462,0.361,0.752,0.478,0.585,0.283
"I forgot, said Wendy lightly.",0.627,0.572,0.358,0.446,0.064,0.467

Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.,0.888,0.828,0.600,0.242,0.469,0.196

While she slept she had a dream.,0.495,0.673,0.439,0.482,0.257,0.156
She dreamt that the Neverland had come too near and that a strange boy had broken through from it.,0.551,0.749,0.028,0.743,0.117,0.242
"He did not alarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have no children.",0.165,0.171,0.892,0.764,0.564,0.130
Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also.,0.874,0.514,0.343,0.929,0.662,0.608
"But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through the gap.",0.672,0.888,0.887,0.572,0.140,0.219
"The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming the window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.",0.985,0.720,0.743,0.931,0.920,0.102
"He was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light that wakened Mrs. Darling.",0.851,0.268,0.927,0.905,0.977,0.218
"She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once that he was Peter Pan.",0.386,0.165,0.790,0.730,0.993,0.015
If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling's kiss.,0.374,0.833,0.512,0.083,0.977,0.155
"He was a lovely boy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth.",0.828,0.091,0.966,0.664,0.804,0.447

"She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window.",0.346,0.714,0.378,0.412,0.991,0.077
"Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was a shooting star.",0.706,0.501,0.934,0.934,0.975,0.028
"She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, which proved to be the boy's shadow.",0.260,0.166,0.971,0.891,0.422,0.341
"As he leapt at the window Nana had closed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.",0.251,0.592,0.641,0.907,0.794,0.140
"You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quite the ordinary kind.",0.883,0.532,0.752,0.746,0.880,0.494
Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow.,0.397,0.072,0.967,0.524,0.820,0.096

"She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say: It all comes of having a dog for",0.761,0.703,0.998,0.953,0.960,0.092
"She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, until a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband.",0.250,0.512,0.141,0.801,0.797,0.911
"The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday.",0.348,0.634,0.603,0.285,0.449,0.405

Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to Nana's eyes.,0.507,0.059,0.918,0.209,0.889,0.773

She was wearing Wendy's bracelet on her arm; she had asked for the loan of it.,0.150,0.081,0.435,0.401,0.608,0.097
Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.,0.032,0.788,0.065,0.763,0.096,0.053
"She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on the occasion of Wendy's birth, and John was saying:",0.169,0.292,0.885,0.855,0.991,0.137

Then he had leapt into her arms.,0.779,0.531,0.371,0.239,0.041,0.308
"Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael's last night in the nursery.",0.795,0.710,0.222,0.443,0.823,0.156

"Sometimes the thing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.",0.116,0.801,0.884,0.412,0.922,0.103
This was such an occasion.,0.350,0.034,0.824,0.501,0.958,0.122
He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.,0.627,0.958,0.564,0.640,0.008,0.785
"Why, what is the matter, father dear?",0.650,0.798,0.973,0.929,0.927,0.095

"This tie, it will not tie.",0.065,0.762,0.901,0.743,0.115,0.320
He became dangerously sarcastic.,0.148,0.809,0.490,0.739,0.018,0.226
Not round my neck!,0.268,0.496,0.122,0.840,0.162,0.460

Oh dear no!,0.185,0.374,0.101,0.120,0.066,0.119
begs to be excused!,0.247,0.951,0.115,0.496,0.286,0.466

"we don't go out to dinner to-night, and if I don't go out to dinner to-night, I never go to the office again, and",0.759,0.958,0.209,0.713,0.575,0.403
"if I don't go to the office again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the streets.",0.183,0.853,0.747,0.851,0.295,0.342
Even then Mrs. Darling was placid.,0.876,0.090,0.922,0.032,0.962,0.381
"Let me try, dear, she said, and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice cool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see their fate decided.",0.647,0.573,0.912,0.870,0.413,0.770
"Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room with Michael on his back.",0.494,0.778,0.654,0.195,0.960,0.033
How wildly we romped!,0.868,0.994,0.283,0.297,0.040,0.323

Mr. Darling groaned.,0.400,0.236,0.239,0.176,0.575,0.202

"They were rather sweet, don't you think, George?",0.023,0.387,0.106,0.672,0.985,0.085
"And they were ours, ours!",0.067,0.819,0.968,0.157,0.948,0.018
and now they are gone.,0.429,0.721,0.221,0.119,0.978,0.023

"They were not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming.",0.377,0.268,0.175,0.987,0.960,0.123
"Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.",0.663,0.629,0.846,0.448,0.679,0.051
"George, Nana is a treasure.",0.559,0.846,0.010,0.823,0.293,0.439

"Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.",0.301,0.168,0.512,0.474,0.228,0.070
"I wonder, Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, I wonder.",0.295,0.303,0.211,0.211,0.286,0.208
"It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy.",0.278,0.500,0.866,0.113,0.937,0.259

"It is nobody I know, he said, examining it carefully, but it does look a scoundrel.",0.118,0.298,0.757,0.936,0.634,0.320
"We were still discussing it, you remember, says Mr. Darling, when Nana came in with Michael's medicine.",0.581,0.689,0.018,0.527,0.862,0.466
"You will never carry the bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.",0.059,0.875,0.805,0.760,0.910,0.291
"Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather foolishly over the medicine.",0.795,0.107,0.472,0.861,0.731,0.205
"If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged the spoon in Nana's mouth, he had said reprovingly, Be a man, Michael.",0.760,0.298,0.406,0.903,0.721,0.608
Michael cried naughtily.,0.506,0.134,0.011,0.200,0.023,0.358
"Mrs. Darling left the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of firmness.",0.451,0.614,0.681,0.354,0.945,0.073
"Mother, don't pamper him, he called after her.",0.627,0.072,0.018,0.541,0.120,0.389
"Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur.",0.549,0.962,0.719,0.441,0.962,0.478
"I said, â€˜Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make me well.'",0.422,0.940,0.455,0.266,0.430,0.621
"He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, That medicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn't it?",0.038,0.535,0.695,0.982,0.953,0.083
"Ever so much nastier, Mr. Darling said bravely, and I would take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn't lost the bottle.",0.071,0.658,0.153,0.683,0.360,0.217
He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top of the wardrobe and hidden it there.,0.065,0.811,0.857,0.800,0.372,0.372
"What he did not know was that the faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.",0.754,0.416,0.984,0.686,0.960,0.138

"I'll bring it, and she was off before he could stop her.",0.760,0.095,0.422,0.613,0.812,0.147
Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.,0.634,0.808,0.777,0.542,0.671,0.249
"John, he said, shuddering, it's most beastly stuff.",0.124,0.192,0.603,0.212,0.056,0.449
"It's that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.",0.158,0.887,0.479,0.833,0.867,0.532
"It will soon be over, father, John said cheerily, and then in rushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.",0.336,0.626,0.640,0.640,0.257,0.353
"I have been as quick as I could, she panted.",0.084,0.417,0.520,0.545,0.037,0.496

"That is not the point, he retorted.",0.691,0.572,0.168,0.889,0.057,0.267
"The point is, that there is more in my glass than in Michael's spoon.",0.747,0.802,0.062,0.971,0.522,0.434
His proud heart was nearly bursting.,0.242,0.372,0.792,0.138,0.266,0.015

"Are you sure, Wendy?",0.809,0.805,0.022,0.810,0.695,0.092
Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window.,0.519,0.583,0.248,0.040,0.602,0.776

"Nothing, precious, she said; they are the eyes a mother leaves behind her to guard her children.",0.117,0.722,0.119,0.808,0.686,0.117

"Mother, he cried, I'm glad of you.",0.426,0.512,0.059,0.338,0.091,0.338
They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.,0.138,0.053,0.620,0.610,0.976,0.037

"They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars were watching them.",0.053,0.510,0.669,0.407,0.971,0.116
"Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever.",0.064,0.831,0.080,0.325,0.956,0.074
It is a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was.,0.151,0.028,0.642,0.791,0.982,0.028

For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly.,0.527,0.192,0.980,0.414,0.614,0.051
"They were awfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy's light blinked and gave such a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all the three went out.",0.670,0.267,0.619,0.771,0.874,0.266
"There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than the night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter's shadow, rummaged the wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out.",0.166,0.467,0.979,0.918,0.320,0.419
"It was not really a light; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing.",0.459,0.624,0.924,0.735,0.683,0.346
"It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage.",0.082,0.508,0.901,0.667,0.935,0.750

"Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my shadow?",0.374,0.281,0.979,0.704,0.426,0.113
The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him.,0.081,0.460,0.036,0.870,0.130,0.438
It is the fairy language.,0.052,0.334,0.764,0.699,0.037,0.232

Tink said that the shadow was in the big box.,0.542,0.482,0.675,0.921,0.849,0.703

"In a moment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.",0.177,0.247,0.803,0.895,0.128,0.559
"If he thought at all, but I don't believe he ever thought, it was that he and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water, and when they did not he was appalled.",0.385,0.670,0.760,0.933,0.981,0.050

"His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed.",0.239,0.666,0.102,0.394,0.347,0.097
She was not alarmed to see a stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.,0.677,0.191,0.942,0.401,0.912,0.058

Is that all?,0.493,0.679,0.711,0.671,0.231,0.417
"Yes, he said rather sharply.",0.414,0.107,0.306,0.688,0.691,0.344

Peter had a sinking.,0.881,0.043,0.672,0.786,0.097,0.575
For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funny address.,0.542,0.406,0.723,0.474,0.668,0.123
"No, it isn't, he said.",0.175,0.488,0.120,0.531,0.029,0.121
"I mean, Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, is that what they put on the letters?",0.431,0.419,0.711,0.782,0.951,0.124

How exactly like a boy!,0.716,0.304,0.967,0.379,0.963,0.544
Fortunately she knew at once what to do.,0.309,0.707,0.431,0.506,0.990,0.003

"she replied with hauteur; if I am no use I can at least withdraw, and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and covered her face with the blankets.",0.956,0.924,0.852,0.755,0.989,0.035
"To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.",0.181,0.514,0.901,0.913,0.635,0.100
"Wendy, he said, don't withdraw.",0.880,0.820,0.004,0.672,0.044,0.309
"I can't help crowing, Wendy, when I'm pleased with myself.",0.133,0.568,0.909,0.244,0.507,0.401
"Still she would not look up, though she was listening eagerly.",0.478,0.058,0.582,0.052,0.943,0.065
"Wendy, he continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.",0.635,0.956,0.047,0.121,0.234,0.137
"Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.",0.275,0.933,0.945,0.530,0.892,0.084
"Do you really think so, Peter?",0.494,0.214,0.811,0.036,0.532,0.092
"Yes, I do.",0.532,0.198,0.436,0.302,0.221,0.035
"I think it's perfectly sweet of you, she declared, and I'll get up again, and she sat with him on the side of the bed.",0.178,0.471,0.501,0.194,0.339,0.074
"She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.",0.562,0.801,0.242,0.206,0.610,0.349
Surely you know what a kiss is?,0.417,0.608,0.336,0.959,0.890,0.319
"she asked, aghast.",0.269,0.517,0.240,0.220,0.014,0.038
"I shall know when you give it to me, he replied stiffly, and not to hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.",0.289,0.633,0.497,0.263,0.241,0.377
"Now, said he, shall I give you a kiss?",0.484,0.748,0.493,0.255,0.740,0.170
"and she replied with a slight primness, If you please.",0.299,0.660,0.302,0.180,0.505,0.108
"She made herself rather cheap by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck.",0.329,0.384,0.934,0.937,0.294,0.341
"It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to save her life.",0.046,0.441,0.956,0.735,0.975,0.109
"When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask each other's age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing, asked Peter how old he was.",0.877,0.072,0.750,0.774,0.912,0.047
"It was not really a happy question to ask him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be asked is Kings of England.",0.001,0.782,0.723,0.952,0.989,0.225
"I don't know, he replied uneasily, but I am quite young.",0.666,0.618,0.461,0.135,0.035,0.499
"He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a venture, Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.",0.677,0.111,0.572,0.704,0.963,0.048
"Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the charming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he could sit nearer her.",0.580,0.745,0.582,0.813,0.821,0.043
"It was because I heard father and mother, he explained in a low voice, talking about what I was to be when I became a man.",0.706,0.094,0.304,0.655,0.962,0.386
He was extraordinarily agitated now.,0.035,0.263,0.901,0.197,0.919,0.087
"I don't want ever to be a man, he said with passion.",0.515,0.101,0.036,0.454,0.025,0.495
I want always to be a little boy and to have fun.,0.362,0.259,0.645,0.614,0.014,0.595
So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the fairies.,0.905,0.566,0.386,0.678,0.375,0.321
"She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it was because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.",0.257,0.417,0.857,0.958,0.936,0.168
Wendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful.,0.344,0.603,0.723,0.414,0.324,0.342
"She poured out questions about them, to his surprise, for they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding.",0.130,0.933,0.868,0.913,0.929,0.118
"Still, he liked them on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.",0.568,0.872,0.083,0.925,0.087,0.052
"You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its laugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning of fairies.",0.618,0.730,0.381,0.964,0.589,0.060
"Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.",0.216,0.731,0.261,0.360,0.995,0.009
"And so, he went on good-naturedly, there ought to be one fairy for every boy and girl.",0.097,0.889,0.960,0.436,0.391,0.212
Ought to be?,0.292,0.699,0.075,0.273,0.077,0.522
"You see children know such a lot now, they soon don't believe in fairies, and every time a child says, â€˜I don't believe in fairies,' there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.",0.003,0.831,0.024,0.973,0.554,0.244
"Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet.",0.376,0.341,0.816,0.458,0.944,0.220
"I can't think where she has gone to, he said, rising, and he called Tink by name.",0.106,0.809,0.286,0.601,0.707,0.074
Wendy's heart went flutter with a sudden thrill.,0.739,0.724,0.446,0.473,0.619,0.569
"Peter, she cried, clutching him, you don't mean to tell me that there is a fairy in this room!",0.427,0.653,0.722,0.774,0.498,0.148
"She was here just now, he said a little impatiently.",0.377,0.739,0.505,0.512,0.728,0.146
"You don't hear her, do you?",0.182,0.347,0.110,0.597,0.149,0.034
and they both listened.,0.049,0.493,0.471,0.522,0.405,0.104
"The only sound I hear, said Wendy, is like a tinkle of bells.",0.341,0.225,0.081,0.848,0.639,0.270
"Well, that's Tink, that's the fairy language.",0.033,0.972,0.922,0.686,0.048,0.742
I think I hear her too.,0.189,0.269,0.325,0.583,0.228,0.187
"The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.",0.208,0.624,0.685,0.386,0.173,0.586
"No one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of gurgles was his laugh.",0.400,0.480,0.810,0.759,0.464,0.249
He had his first laugh still.,0.666,0.822,0.173,0.134,0.030,0.265
"Wendy, he whispered gleefully, I do believe I shut her up in the drawer!",0.792,0.588,0.072,0.928,0.305,0.088
"He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery screaming with fury.",0.490,0.063,0.163,0.949,0.132,0.113
"You shouldn't say such things, Peter retorted.",0.827,0.426,0.386,0.328,0.452,0.552
"Of course I'm very sorry, but how could I know you were in the drawer?",0.155,0.430,0.065,0.497,0.859,0.256
Wendy was not listening to him.,0.077,0.892,0.843,0.100,0.896,0.130
"O Peter, she cried, if she would only stand still and let me see her!",0.702,0.380,0.089,0.172,0.200,0.136
"They hardly ever stand still, he said, but for one moment Wendy saw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock.",0.307,0.313,0.111,0.631,0.055,0.092
O the lovely!,0.485,0.302,0.497,0.057,0.009,0.733
"she cried, though Tink's face was still distorted with passion.",0.492,0.520,0.517,0.041,0.962,0.216
"Tink, said Peter amiably, this lady says she wishes you were her fairy.",0.440,0.753,0.445,0.503,0.966,0.196
Tinker Bell answered insolently.,0.585,0.277,0.316,0.728,0.486,0.584
"What does she say, Peter?",0.303,0.131,0.506,0.350,0.753,0.414
He had to translate.,0.593,0.101,0.091,0.267,0.061,0.264
She is not very polite.,0.140,0.678,0.031,0.663,0.218,0.182
"She says you are a great ugly girl, and that she is my fairy.",0.384,0.980,0.682,0.915,0.855,0.116
He tried to argue with Tink.,0.758,0.760,0.302,0.395,0.147,0.194
"You know you can't be my fairy, Tink, because I am an gentleman and you are a lady.",0.814,0.922,0.878,0.706,0.609,0.225
"To this Tink replied in these words, You silly ass, and disappeared into the bathroom.",0.068,0.962,0.431,0.873,0.607,0.740
"She is quite a common fairy, Peter explained apologetically, she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots and kettles.",0.066,0.766,0.782,0.830,0.495,0.154
"They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him with more questions.",0.221,0.475,0.293,0.759,0.963,0.054

Sometimes I do still.,0.158,0.379,0.265,0.150,0.803,0.088
But where do you live mostly now?,0.163,0.830,0.532,0.159,0.761,0.022
With the lost boys.,0.597,0.222,0.018,0.001,0.040,0.276
Who are they?,0.504,0.023,0.501,0.340,0.759,0.176
They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurse is looking the other way.,0.425,0.263,0.597,0.940,0.554,0.078
If they are not claimed in seven days they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses.,0.204,0.318,0.696,0.666,0.976,0.072
What fun it must be!,0.448,0.379,0.700,0.165,0.890,0.300
"Yes, said cunning Peter, but we are rather lonely.",0.691,0.965,0.461,0.408,0.887,0.243
You see we have no female companionship.,0.458,0.664,0.666,0.652,0.036,0.355
Are none of the others girls?,0.882,0.345,0.027,0.536,0.938,0.628
"Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their prams.",0.442,0.358,0.037,0.229,0.262,0.106
This flattered Wendy immensely.,0.494,0.416,0.103,0.877,0.127,0.352
"I think, she said, it is perfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.",0.493,0.817,0.593,0.587,0.928,0.090
"For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick.",0.273,0.146,0.732,0.880,0.322,0.471
"This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him with spirit that he was not captain in her house.",0.229,0.838,0.530,0.864,0.840,0.064
"However, John continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there.",0.683,0.727,0.642,0.566,0.649,0.123
"And I know you meant to be kind, she said, relenting, so you may give me a kiss.",0.106,0.447,0.284,0.395,0.081,0.560
For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses.,0.617,0.927,0.630,0.375,0.037,0.109
"I thought you would want it back, he said a little bitterly, and offered to return her the thimble.",0.524,0.445,0.778,0.872,0.239,0.251
"Oh dear, said the nice Wendy, I don't mean a kiss, I mean a thimble.",0.150,0.717,0.040,0.605,0.100,0.348
It's like this.,0.391,0.221,0.701,0.779,0.978,0.264
She kissed him.,0.075,0.193,0.191,0.249,0.101,0.246
Funny! said Peter gravely.,0.781,0.108,0.450,0.065,0.040,0.452
Now shall I give you a thimble?,0.578,0.862,0.424,0.514,0.875,0.187
"If you wish to, said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.",0.400,0.476,0.220,0.054,0.320,0.225
"Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched.",0.399,0.278,0.683,0.517,0.413,0.199
"What is it, Wendy?",0.270,0.649,0.289,0.738,0.793,0.123
It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.,0.170,0.103,0.952,0.193,0.989,0.118
That must have been Tink.,0.723,0.777,0.432,0.529,0.317,0.454
I never knew her so naughty before.,0.507,0.479,0.803,0.212,0.051,0.432

"Again Tink replied, You silly ass.",0.706,0.953,0.409,0.844,0.684,0.442
"Peter could not understand why, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he admitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen to stories.",0.198,0.301,0.758,0.752,0.570,0.383
"You see, I don't know any stories.",0.691,0.168,0.020,0.369,0.042,0.397

"Do you know, Peter asked why swallows build in the eaves of houses?",0.150,0.181,0.949,0.236,0.428,0.293
It is to listen to the stories.,0.188,0.091,0.678,0.661,0.070,0.550
"O Wendy, your mother was telling you such a lovely story.",0.501,0.458,0.621,0.109,0.705,0.216

About the prince who couldn't find the lady who wore the glass slipper.,0.452,0.025,0.694,0.801,0.516,0.564
"Peter, said Wendy excitedly, that was Cinderella, and he found her, and they lived happily ever after.",0.863,0.075,0.043,0.067,0.884,0.323
"Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, and hurried to the window.",0.683,0.101,0.839,0.205,0.625,0.387
Where are you going?,0.458,0.701,0.155,0.428,0.915,0.046
she cried with misgiving.,0.112,0.336,0.059,0.075,0.140,0.082
To tell the other boys.,0.365,0.486,0.142,0.001,0.013,0.491

John rubbed his eyes.,0.341,0.710,0.898,0.288,0.015,0.782
"Then I shall get up, he said.",0.859,0.315,0.345,0.345,0.306,0.037
Of course he was on the floor already.,0.038,0.191,0.759,0.223,0.858,0.216
"Hallo, he said, I am up!",0.465,0.648,0.213,0.913,0.436,0.229
"Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six blades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence.",0.319,0.050,0.624,0.439,0.614,0.202
Their faces assumed the awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world.,0.962,0.036,0.563,0.214,0.168,0.137
All was as still as salt.,0.122,0.066,0.569,0.520,0.817,0.474
Then everything was right.,0.197,0.596,0.948,0.453,0.908,0.027
Everything was wrong.,0.002,0.375,0.868,0.467,0.978,0.064
"Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now.",0.838,0.138,0.966,0.098,0.958,0.200
It was her silence they had heard.,0.716,0.072,0.876,0.403,0.822,0.412
Out with the light!,0.926,0.074,0.274,0.232,0.066,0.570
"Quick! cried John, taking command for the only time throughout the whole adventure.",0.085,0.951,0.739,0.023,0.045,0.289
"And thus when Liza entered, holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as they slept.",0.160,0.511,0.943,0.859,0.241,0.227
They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.,0.006,0.253,0.029,0.895,0.945,0.624
"Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in the kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, by Nana's absurd suspicions.",0.443,0.448,0.578,0.913,0.967,0.232
"She thought the best way of getting a little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.",0.710,0.803,0.649,0.411,0.784,0.048
"There, you suspicious brute, she said, not sorry that Nana was in disgrace.",0.629,0.831,0.859,0.187,0.933,0.214
"They are perfectly safe, aren't they?",0.099,0.065,0.500,0.123,0.941,0.033
Every one of the little angels sound asleep in bed.,0.463,0.400,0.971,0.784,0.027,0.484
Listen to their gentle breathing.,0.671,0.339,0.910,0.869,0.084,0.592
"Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they were nearly detected.",0.513,0.777,0.179,0.530,0.797,0.034
"Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to drag herself out of Liza's clutches.",0.421,0.658,0.881,0.925,0.137,0.453
But Liza was dense.,0.412,0.097,0.976,0.802,0.984,0.174
"No more of it, Nana, she said sternly, pulling her out of the room.",0.572,0.363,0.107,0.526,0.522,0.106
"I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh, won't master whip you, just.",0.503,0.128,0.373,0.635,0.243,0.186
"She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark?",0.075,0.577,0.922,0.698,0.930,0.042
Bring master and missus home from the party!,0.969,0.174,0.108,0.831,0.167,0.753
"Why, that was just what she wanted.",0.396,0.192,0.895,0.416,0.951,0.090
Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe?,0.139,0.119,0.945,0.095,0.968,0.026
"Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she broke it.",0.766,0.790,0.589,0.947,0.997,0.008
"In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most expressive way of making a communication.",0.466,0.370,0.679,0.602,0.302,0.264
"Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery, and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.",0.600,0.510,0.164,0.934,0.968,0.021
"But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.",0.790,0.336,0.936,0.815,0.811,0.070
We now return to the nursery.,0.187,0.966,0.168,0.432,0.491,0.149
"It's all right, John announced, emerging from his hiding-place.",0.438,0.461,0.791,0.136,0.313,0.666
"I say, Peter, can you really fly?",0.626,0.398,0.354,0.466,0.194,0.444
"Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking the mantelpiece on the way.",0.766,0.192,0.852,0.349,0.756,0.318
How topping! said John and Michael.,0.800,0.664,0.032,0.278,0.220,0.362
How sweet! cried Wendy.,0.834,0.830,0.083,0.218,0.077,0.254
"Yes, I'm sweet,",0.471,0.303,0.433,0.496,0.815,0.606
"oh, I am sweet! said Peter, forgetting his manners again.",0.740,0.623,0.616,0.071,0.480,0.390
"It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and then from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.",0.813,0.342,0.239,0.804,0.483,0.050
"I say, how do you do it? asked John, rubbing his knee.",0.530,0.588,0.384,0.342,0.309,0.097
He was quite a practical boy.,0.270,0.065,0.916,0.182,0.698,0.118
"You just think lovely wonderful thoughts, Peter explained, and they lift you up in the air.",0.831,0.232,0.878,0.119,0.561,0.383
He showed them again.,0.321,0.283,0.130,0.597,0.264,0.078
"You're so nippy at it, John said, couldn't you do it very slowly once?",0.206,0.469,0.359,0.297,0.978,0.031
Peter did it both slowly and quickly.,0.390,0.236,0.836,0.384,0.672,0.215
"I've got it now, Wendy! cried John, but soon he found he had not.",0.759,0.229,0.953,0.540,0.106,0.185
"Not one of them could fly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not know A from Z.",0.305,0.438,0.963,0.936,0.935,0.354
"Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless the fairy dust has been blown on him.",0.239,0.413,0.836,0.215,0.274,0.169
"Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superb results.",0.026,0.658,0.957,0.153,0.766,0.068
"Now just wiggle your shoulders this way, he said, and let go.",0.676,0.186,0.032,0.495,0.848,0.225
"They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first.",0.628,0.377,0.024,0.648,0.978,0.071
"He did not quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.",0.356,0.193,0.768,0.822,0.968,0.164
he screamed while still in mid-air.,0.328,0.725,0.201,0.030,0.295,0.541
John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.,0.760,0.965,0.016,0.499,0.435,0.557
Look at me!,0.401,0.225,0.765,0.780,0.997,0.006
Look at me!,0.401,0.225,0.765,0.780,0.997,0.006
Look at me!,0.401,0.225,0.765,0.780,0.997,0.006
"They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothing so delicious as that.",0.059,0.850,0.293,0.915,0.887,0.096
"Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tink was so indignant.",0.478,0.657,0.800,0.293,0.982,0.043
"Up and down they went, and round and round.",0.561,0.632,0.017,0.477,0.600,0.132
Heavenly was Wendy's word.,0.658,0.237,0.735,0.374,0.958,0.405
"I say, cried John, why shouldn't we all go out?",0.684,0.877,0.182,0.495,0.546,0.712
Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.,0.906,0.017,0.844,0.090,0.914,0.472
Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles.,0.177,0.145,0.902,0.210,0.947,0.069
But Wendy hesitated.,0.129,0.622,0.040,0.671,0.024,0.171
Mermaids! said Peter again.,0.907,0.325,0.404,0.076,0.367,0.368
And there are pirates.,0.934,0.938,0.019,0.650,0.926,0.090
"Pirates, cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, let us go at once.",0.385,0.581,0.002,0.854,0.998,0.007
It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of 27.,0.810,0.475,0.770,0.192,0.996,0.026
"They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the",0.336,0.719,0.755,0.944,0.906,0.326
floor but in the air.,0.839,0.454,0.402,0.551,0.478,0.767
"Not three figures, four!",0.573,0.002,0.825,0.482,0.017,0.440
In a tremble they opened the street door.,0.585,0.088,0.394,0.871,0.501,0.350
"Mr. Darling would have rushed upstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly.",0.369,0.244,0.625,0.239,0.918,0.402
She even tried to make her heart go softly.,0.498,0.839,0.725,0.264,0.384,0.230
Will they reach the nursery in time?,0.271,0.479,0.480,0.654,0.898,0.137
"If so, how delightful for them, and we shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story.",0.274,0.942,0.514,0.482,0.553,0.128
"On the other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come right in the end.",0.459,0.508,0.617,0.542,0.161,0.225
They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the little stars were watching them.,0.254,0.605,0.220,0.471,0.895,0.184
"Once again the stars blew the window open, and that smallest star of all called out:",0.709,0.465,0.249,0.685,0.566,0.178
Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose.,0.415,0.474,0.963,0.399,0.909,0.105
"Come, he cried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and Michael and Wendy.",0.134,0.392,0.125,0.506,0.772,0.018
Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late.,0.851,0.142,0.033,0.560,0.345,0.328
The birds were flown.,0.795,0.544,0.473,0.096,0.907,0.074
"Second to the right, and straight on till morning.",0.494,0.175,0.692,0.721,0.560,0.035
"That, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even birds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not have sighted it with these instructions.",0.289,0.775,0.872,0.379,0.985,0.059
"Peter, you see, just said anything that came into his head.",0.724,0.572,0.535,0.076,0.144,0.261
"At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.",0.946,0.363,0.714,0.822,0.983,0.063
"John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.",0.436,0.526,0.009,0.441,0.218,0.105
They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.,0.538,0.543,0.501,0.856,0.613,0.029
Not long ago.,0.302,0.765,0.630,0.850,0.006,0.123
But how long ago?,0.506,0.284,0.775,0.854,0.013,0.094
They were flying over the sea before this thought began to disturb Wendy seriously.,0.058,0.142,0.133,0.579,0.980,0.051
John thought it was their second sea and their third night.,0.303,0.696,0.376,0.469,0.977,0.135
"Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold and again too warm.",0.092,0.401,0.894,0.292,0.987,0.072
"Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them?",0.788,0.034,0.506,0.813,0.997,0.044
"His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will.",0.140,0.316,0.105,0.723,0.980,0.040
"But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that there are other ways.",0.133,0.725,0.508,0.725,0.990,0.416
"Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell.",0.156,0.342,0.822,0.745,0.988,0.037
The awful thing was that Peter thought this funny.,0.510,0.203,0.954,0.233,0.961,0.180
There he goes again!,0.757,0.668,0.065,0.624,0.230,0.091
"he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly dropped like a stone.",0.050,0.350,0.924,0.294,0.550,0.215
"Save him, save him!",0.011,0.115,0.997,0.852,0.307,0.360
"cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel sea far below.",0.909,0.870,0.002,0.519,0.963,0.008
"Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life.",0.112,0.822,0.956,0.743,0.753,0.134
"Also he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would let you go.",0.795,0.422,0.073,0.356,0.863,0.188
"He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back and floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light",0.533,0.070,0.946,0.888,0.994,0.023
that if you got behind him and blew he went faster.,0.851,0.684,0.289,0.092,0.071,0.137
"Do be more polite to him, Wendy whispered to John, when they were playing Follow my Leader.",0.615,0.643,0.748,0.216,0.970,0.060
"Then tell him to stop showing off, said John.",0.867,0.598,0.369,0.218,0.236,0.218
"When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and touch each shark's tail in passing, just as in the street you may run your finger along an iron railing.",0.217,0.213,0.931,0.480,0.409,0.203
"They could not follow him in this with much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.",0.062,0.303,0.438,0.823,0.926,0.074
"You must be nice to him, Wendy impressed on her brothers.",0.414,0.870,0.528,0.289,0.504,0.304
What could we do if he were to leave us!,0.125,0.731,0.468,0.236,0.994,0.017
"We could go back, Michael said.",0.306,0.728,0.167,0.580,0.051,0.696
How could we ever find our way back without him?,0.221,0.894,0.282,0.645,0.148,0.446
"Well, then, we could go on, said John.",0.500,0.882,0.317,0.201,0.090,0.580
"That is the awful thing, John.",0.671,0.264,0.382,0.632,0.232,0.476
"We should have to go on, for we don't know how to stop.",0.835,0.654,0.172,0.356,0.090,0.267
"This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.",0.187,0.004,0.750,0.227,0.671,0.182
"John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to go straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back to their own window.",0.097,0.655,0.507,0.504,0.800,0.092
"And who is to get food for us, John?",0.239,0.440,0.311,0.639,0.866,0.053
"I nipped a bit out of that eagle's mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.",0.097,0.557,0.697,0.810,0.532,0.476
"After the twentieth try, Wendy reminded him.",0.311,0.740,0.499,0.421,0.304,0.198
"And even though we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things if he is not near to give us a hand.",0.836,0.955,0.034,0.906,0.961,0.098
Indeed they were constantly bumping.,0.043,0.080,0.015,0.151,0.967,0.027
"They could now fly strongly, though they still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it.",0.045,0.218,0.943,0.667,0.956,0.069
"If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael's forehead by this time.",0.837,0.491,0.552,0.394,0.532,0.201
"Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there by themselves.",0.054,0.315,0.853,0.144,0.815,0.069
"He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share.",0.025,0.128,0.673,0.435,0.649,0.207
"He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had been happening.",0.579,0.241,0.591,0.533,0.580,0.158
It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.,0.681,0.011,0.559,0.440,0.804,0.415
"And if he forgets them so quickly, Wendy argued, how can we expect that he will go on remembering us?",0.870,0.894,0.047,0.385,0.922,0.064
"Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well.",0.174,0.102,0.953,0.295,0.994,0.017
Wendy was sure of it.,0.080,0.679,0.594,0.776,0.939,0.204
She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.,0.588,0.309,0.889,0.485,0.304,0.192
"I'm Wendy, she said agitatedly.",0.137,0.595,0.042,0.491,0.100,0.253
He was very sorry.,0.290,0.233,0.507,0.149,0.866,0.104
"I say, Wendy, he whispered to her, always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying â€˜I'm Wendy,' and then I'll remember.",0.894,0.730,0.054,0.445,0.703,0.403
Of course this was rather unsatisfactory.,0.599,0.028,0.738,0.490,0.972,0.156

"So with occasional tiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them.",0.119,0.112,0.850,0.978,0.800,0.095

"In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in silence.",0.142,0.144,0.644,0.696,0.528,0.142
"It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by a distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at the ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.",0.702,0.060,0.949,0.533,0.993,0.046
Even these noises ceased.,0.537,0.863,0.124,0.263,0.408,0.403
To Michael the loneliness was dreadful.,0.348,0.110,0.530,0.032,0.914,0.346
If only something would make a sound!,0.107,0.416,0.862,0.070,0.067,0.106

What else could poor Wendy do?,0.287,0.011,0.542,0.087,0.490,0.014
"She called to Peter and John and Michael, and got only mocking echoes in reply.",0.335,0.058,0.218,0.612,0.326,0.199
She did not yet know that Tink hated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman.,0.103,0.953,0.179,0.493,0.935,0.197

In his absence things are usually quiet on the island.,0.667,0.865,0.899,0.677,0.396,0.242

They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground.,0.144,0.163,0.322,0.771,0.298,0.115
It was the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in the neighbourhood.,0.249,0.202,0.555,0.163,0.950,0.368

"A lady to take care of us at last, said one of the twins, and you have killed her!",0.772,0.216,0.392,0.712,0.997,0.008

"Tootles' face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that had never been there before.",0.693,0.439,0.973,0.184,0.983,0.279

"Don't go, they called in pity.",0.583,0.772,0.133,0.541,0.346,0.475
"I must, he answered, shaking; I am so afraid of Peter.",0.670,0.701,0.594,0.264,0.032,0.145
It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart of every one of them rise to his mouth.,0.611,0.441,0.821,0.221,0.995,0.044
They heard Peter crow.,0.165,0.134,0.498,0.086,0.418,0.693

But Tootles stood aloof.,0.220,0.068,0.624,0.768,0.006,0.140
"Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.",0.611,0.308,0.587,0.492,0.289,0.588
"Greetings, boys, he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then again was silence.",0.183,0.045,0.695,0.126,0.890,0.056

"They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come.",0.107,0.381,0.780,0.738,0.175,0.047
He overlooked it in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.,0.215,0.932,0.927,0.218,0.087,0.315
"Great news, boys, he cried, I have brought at last a mother for you all.",0.530,0.366,0.438,0.146,0.991,0.015
"Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees.",0.453,0.816,0.014,0.155,0.030,0.661

"So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a little time he did not know what to do next.",0.378,0.113,0.420,0.654,0.215,0.063
"She is dead, he said uncomfortably.",0.598,0.477,0.800,0.671,0.063,0.129
Perhaps she is frightened at being dead.,0.002,0.968,0.362,0.939,0.997,0.007

They would all have been glad to follow if he had done this.,0.431,0.210,0.380,0.421,0.455,0.196
But there was the arrow.,0.097,0.196,0.930,0.766,0.947,0.107
He took it from her heart and faced his band.,0.227,0.414,0.584,0.624,0.346,0.190
he demanded sternly.,0.155,0.163,0.081,0.735,0.019,0.080
"Mine, Peter, said Tootles on his knees.",0.869,0.712,0.025,0.825,0.217,0.832
"Oh, dastard hand, Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a dagger.",0.084,0.061,0.761,0.188,0.070,0.561
Tootles did not flinch.,0.215,0.748,0.345,0.814,0.888,0.405
He bared his breast.,0.492,0.541,0.199,0.324,0.007,0.242
"Strike, Peter, he said firmly, strike true.",0.873,0.392,0.478,0.368,0.089,0.081
"Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall.",0.121,0.199,0.900,0.730,0.549,0.387

"Wonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm.",0.187,0.556,0.399,0.460,0.077,0.441
Nibs bent over her and listened reverently.,0.139,0.910,0.950,0.472,0.095,0.315

Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button.,0.437,0.393,0.563,0.207,0.448,0.381
You remember she had put it on a chain that she wore round her neck.,0.142,0.369,0.186,0.685,0.372,0.142
"See, he said, the arrow struck against this.",0.782,0.534,0.465,0.246,0.125,0.256
It is the kiss I gave her.,0.242,0.605,0.224,0.727,0.378,0.372
It has saved her life.,0.046,0.334,0.357,0.540,0.396,0.256

Begone from me for ever.,0.885,0.161,0.103,0.239,0.052,0.485
"She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off.",0.244,0.850,0.477,0.854,0.111,0.127
"Not until Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say, Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.",0.976,0.977,0.043,0.064,0.617,0.289
Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm?,0.808,0.272,0.872,0.373,0.938,0.068
"Oh dear no, never wanted to pinch her so much.",0.127,0.693,0.278,0.057,0.114,0.085
"Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed them.",0.130,0.172,0.948,0.902,0.395,0.350
But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?,0.286,0.817,0.744,0.284,0.770,0.105
"Let us carry her down into the house, Curly suggested.",0.267,0.795,0.173,0.383,0.850,0.034
"Ay, said Slightly, that is what one does with ladies.",0.722,0.369,0.363,0.742,0.290,0.146
"No, no, Peter said, you must not touch her.",0.328,0.588,0.497,0.213,0.323,0.180
It would not be sufficiently respectful.,0.458,0.841,0.824,0.773,0.603,0.397
"That, said Slightly, is what I was thinking.",0.592,0.365,0.723,0.782,0.913,0.311
"But if she lies there, Tootles said, she will die.",0.099,0.810,0.525,0.680,0.438,0.176
"Ay, she will die, Slightly admitted, but there is no way out.",0.191,0.661,0.567,0.847,0.353,0.367
"Yes, there is, cried Peter.",0.596,0.060,0.499,0.294,0.755,0.372
Let us build a little house round her.,0.702,0.404,0.001,0.408,0.770,0.105
They were all delighted.,0.012,0.054,0.513,0.672,0.985,0.070
"Quick, he ordered them, bring me each of you the best of what we have.",0.438,0.995,0.335,0.069,0.225,0.135
Gut our house.,0.612,0.789,0.205,0.748,0.244,0.393
In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.,0.044,0.541,0.349,0.375,0.901,0.147
"They skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael.",0.102,0.110,0.482,0.895,0.995,0.017
"As they dragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step and slept again.",0.097,0.582,0.264,0.586,0.455,0.106
"John, John, Michael would cry, wake up!",0.223,0.454,0.986,0.128,0.708,0.232
"Where is Nana, John, and mother?",0.214,0.892,0.069,0.760,0.044,0.387
"And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, It is true, we did fly.",0.579,0.948,0.592,0.860,0.767,0.152
You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.,0.109,0.056,0.273,0.115,0.954,0.331
"Hullo, Peter, they said.",0.257,0.006,0.602,0.163,0.533,0.225
"Hullo, replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them.",0.077,0.124,0.741,0.046,0.058,0.339
He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see how large a house she would need.,0.471,0.691,0.780,0.221,0.983,0.017
Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and a table.,0.534,0.257,0.620,0.582,0.117,0.384
John and Michael watched him.,0.049,0.219,0.142,0.097,0.112,0.397
Is Wendy asleep?,0.850,0.795,0.052,0.804,0.027,0.398
"John, Michael proposed, let us wake her and get her to make supper for us, but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying branches for the building of the house.",0.736,0.800,0.874,0.786,0.705,0.069
Look at them!,0.485,0.154,0.819,0.756,0.997,0.009
"Curly, said Peter in his most captainy voice, see that these boys help in the building of the house.",0.292,0.622,0.158,0.245,0.610,0.379
"Ay, ay, sir.",0.277,0.323,0.922,0.527,0.014,0.808
Build a house?,0.467,0.387,0.660,0.156,0.140,0.430
"For the Wendy, said Curly.",0.939,0.584,0.086,0.507,0.418,0.105
"John said, aghast.",0.549,0.411,0.487,0.311,0.022,0.464
"Why, she is only a girl!",0.100,0.934,0.405,0.695,0.723,0.077
"That, explained Curly, is why we are her servants.",0.855,0.990,0.606,0.827,0.906,0.085
"Yes, said Peter, and you also.",0.750,0.197,0.513,0.145,0.501,0.465
Away with them.,0.663,0.066,0.277,0.125,0.088,0.420
The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.,0.004,0.681,0.277,0.424,0.812,0.286
"Chairs and a fender first, Peter ordered.",0.539,0.397,0.717,0.373,0.020,0.044
Then we shall build a house round them.,0.889,0.897,0.049,0.086,0.507,0.268
"Ay, said Slightly, that is how a house is built; it all comes back to me.",0.776,0.356,0.597,0.858,0.201,0.453
Peter thought of everything.,0.744,0.511,0.569,0.443,0.662,0.290
"Slightly, he cried, fetch a doctor.",0.570,0.199,0.016,0.123,0.239,0.317
"Ay, ay, said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.",0.038,0.437,0.071,0.234,0.975,0.076
"But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing John's hat and looking solemn.",0.265,0.135,0.971,0.947,0.074,0.070
"Please, sir, said Peter, going to him, are you a doctor?",0.857,0.365,0.896,0.064,0.950,0.128
"The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the same thing.",0.741,0.757,0.973,0.815,0.981,0.022
"This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that they had had their dinners.",0.055,0.012,0.726,0.965,0.328,0.271
If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.,0.501,0.498,0.501,0.342,0.328,0.192
"Yes, my little man, Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped knuckles.",0.490,0.315,0.919,0.476,0.130,0.622
"Please, sir, Peter explained, a lady lies very ill.",0.847,0.560,0.952,0.382,0.842,0.210
"She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.",0.628,0.639,0.885,0.692,0.977,0.013
"Tut, tut, tut, he said, where does she lie?",0.009,0.048,0.092,0.541,0.201,0.322
In yonder glade.,0.527,0.533,0.749,0.599,0.429,0.651
"I will put a glass thing in her mouth, said Slightly, and he made-believe to do it, while Peter waited.",0.145,0.208,0.204,0.296,0.364,0.217
It was an anxious moment when the glass thing was withdrawn.,0.100,0.070,0.949,0.873,0.937,0.223
How is she? inquired Peter.,0.780,0.234,0.388,0.166,0.116,0.224
"Tut, tut, tut, said Slightly, this has cured her.",0.169,0.105,0.043,0.557,0.257,0.381
I am glad!,0.406,0.492,0.834,0.308,0.029,0.659
"I will call again in the evening, Slightly said; give her beef tea out of a cup with a spout to it; but after he had returned the hat to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a difficulty.",0.118,0.251,0.743,0.991,0.958,0.368
In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost everything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy's feet.,0.116,0.505,0.772,0.877,0.990,0.098
"If only we knew, said one, the kind of house she likes best.",0.223,0.831,0.476,0.593,0.696,0.118
"Peter, shouted another, she is moving in her sleep.",0.019,0.688,0.725,0.875,0.538,0.259
"Her mouth opens, cried a third, looking respectfully into it.",0.596,0.737,0.549,0.346,0.088,0.271
"Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep, said Peter.",0.190,0.573,0.227,0.523,0.749,0.244
"Wendy, sing the kind of house you would like to have.",0.061,0.712,0.514,0.184,0.672,0.213
"Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:",0.730,0.924,0.081,0.630,0.197,0.438
"I wish I had a pretty house,",0.065,0.598,0.342,0.237,0.106,0.328
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚,0.019,0.033,0.000,0.003,0.001,0.280
"The littlest ever seen, With funny little red walls Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚",0.051,0.058,0.783,0.574,0.012,0.404
And roof of mossy green.,0.005,0.511,0.269,0.671,0.037,0.116
"They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted with moss.",0.110,0.523,0.865,0.450,0.991,0.024
As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves:,0.181,0.367,0.439,0.168,0.067,0.197
"We've built the little walls and roof Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â And made a lovely door, So tell us, mother Wendy,",0.752,0.717,0.666,0.147,0.421,0.109
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚,0.019,0.033,0.000,0.003,0.001,0.280
What are you wanting more?,0.655,0.379,0.616,0.477,0.981,0.071
To this she answered greedily:,0.096,0.736,0.423,0.747,0.141,0.231
"Oh, really next I think I'll have Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Gay windows all about, With roses peeping in,",0.523,0.183,0.156,0.213,0.071,0.412
"you know, Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â And babies peeping out.",0.898,0.480,0.787,0.407,0.236,0.328
"With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were the blinds.",0.473,0.776,0.186,0.539,0.985,0.055
But roses ?,0.550,0.506,0.082,0.795,0.010,0.188
"Roses, cried Peter sternly.",0.656,0.112,0.537,0.019,0.104,0.298
Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.,0.139,0.442,0.659,0.559,0.129,0.050
To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:,0.742,0.169,0.742,0.760,0.608,0.171
"We've made the roses peeping out,",0.768,0.369,0.152,0.090,0.028,0.086
Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚,0.019,0.033,0.000,0.003,0.001,0.280
"The babes are at the door, We cannot make ourselves, you know, Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â Ã‚Â 'Cos we've been made before.",0.935,0.845,0.239,0.079,0.990,0.038
"Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his own.",0.416,0.212,0.817,0.145,0.991,0.019
"The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though, of course, they could no longer see her.",0.215,0.701,0.884,0.504,0.913,0.051
"Peter strode up and down, ordering finishing touches.",0.905,0.135,0.687,0.785,0.037,0.675
Nothing escaped his eagle eyes.,0.828,0.708,0.487,0.843,0.037,0.614
Just when it seemed absolutely finished:,0.645,0.028,0.942,0.280,0.173,0.188
"There's no knocker on the door, he said.",0.687,0.438,0.072,0.643,0.061,0.415
"They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it made an excellent knocker.",0.238,0.551,0.989,0.024,0.908,0.188
"Absolutely finished now, they thought.",0.154,0.563,0.175,0.203,0.968,0.082
Not of bit of it.,0.240,0.933,0.080,0.424,0.339,0.505
"There's no chimney, Peter said; we must have a chimney.",0.338,0.835,0.331,0.359,0.077,0.606
"It certainly does need a chimney, said John importantly.",0.558,0.809,0.398,0.409,0.215,0.396
This gave Peter an idea.,0.344,0.143,0.763,0.183,0.509,0.258
"He snatched the hat off John's head, knocked out the bottom, and put the hat on the roof.",0.198,0.964,0.269,0.974,0.510,0.097
"The little house was so pleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began to come out of the hat.",0.378,0.407,0.995,0.936,0.197,0.272
Now really and truly it was finished.,0.506,0.069,0.891,0.274,0.960,0.102
Nothing remained to do but to knock.,0.051,0.368,0.634,0.662,0.204,0.137
"All look your best, Peter warned them; first impressions are awfully important.",0.896,0.419,0.946,0.119,0.794,0.384
He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all too busy looking their best.,0.442,0.633,0.962,0.513,0.981,0.034
"He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openly sneering.",0.793,0.209,0.456,0.974,0.898,0.541
"What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock?",0.496,0.283,0.871,0.198,0.979,0.096
"If a lady, what would she be like?",0.339,0.440,0.746,0.360,0.977,0.085
The door opened and a lady came out.,0.929,0.583,0.306,0.815,0.408,0.418
It was Wendy.,0.379,0.101,0.652,0.205,0.911,0.125
They all whipped off their hats.,0.189,0.527,0.960,0.537,0.878,0.188
"She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she would look.",0.537,0.169,0.952,0.588,0.811,0.013
Where am I?,0.289,0.588,0.433,0.611,0.118,0.420
Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in.,0.521,0.379,0.481,0.193,0.599,0.085
", he said rapidly, for you we built this house.",0.520,0.820,0.526,0.320,0.123,0.090
"Oh, say you're pleased, cried Nibs.",0.037,0.585,0.955,0.385,0.186,0.501
"Lovely, darling house, Wendy said, and they were the very words they had hoped she would say.",0.565,0.657,0.818,0.587,0.941,0.134
"And we are your children, cried the twins.",0.525,0.419,0.444,0.240,0.881,0.105
"Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, O Wendy lady, be our mother.",0.757,0.567,0.041,0.794,0.225,0.458
"Wendy said, all shining.",0.363,0.623,0.485,0.512,0.373,0.250
"Of course it's frightfully fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl.",0.341,0.827,0.237,0.276,0.190,0.260
I have no real experience.,0.425,0.100,0.021,0.603,0.056,0.447
"That doesn't matter, said Peter, as if he were the only person present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew least.",0.076,0.357,0.659,0.901,0.870,0.131
What we need is just a nice motherly person.,0.595,0.775,0.796,0.930,0.617,0.324
"Wendy said, you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.",0.744,0.892,0.823,0.932,0.902,0.459
"It is, it is, they all cried; we saw it at once.",0.112,0.838,0.041,0.878,0.994,0.007
"Very well, she said, I will do my best.",0.267,0.907,0.162,0.160,0.403,0.092
"Come inside at once, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp.",0.211,0.905,0.474,0.613,0.906,0.013
And before I put you to bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.,0.296,0.431,0.122,0.179,0.212,0.351
"In they went; I don't know how there was room for them, but you can squeeze very tight in the Neverland.",0.885,0.894,0.336,0.391,0.980,0.173
And that was the first of the many joyous evenings they had with Wendy.,0.118,0.185,0.787,0.413,0.704,0.102
"By and by she tucked them up in the great bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl.",0.667,0.620,0.716,0.905,0.949,0.131
"The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds, and the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard.",0.238,0.807,0.870,0.524,0.125,0.152
"After a time he fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from an orgy.",0.814,0.319,0.138,0.742,0.882,0.522
"Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter's nose and passed on.",0.275,0.694,0.467,0.742,0.989,0.021
One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees.,0.452,0.176,0.849,0.331,0.627,0.567
"Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size.",0.358,0.393,0.900,0.701,0.867,0.114
"Once you fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up.",0.286,0.746,0.023,0.922,0.995,0.016
"when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful.",0.157,0.675,0.412,0.562,0.747,0.108
"But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.",0.628,0.951,0.642,0.237,0.251,0.230
"Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you fit.",0.806,0.404,0.761,0.699,0.901,0.111

"Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to be altered a little.",0.688,0.879,0.127,0.866,0.955,0.072
After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well.,0.111,0.194,0.181,0.478,0.705,0.553
And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground; especially Wendy.,0.588,0.838,0.278,0.191,0.271,0.172
"It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools.",0.932,0.320,0.162,0.923,0.968,0.060
"A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor.",0.964,0.732,0.927,0.267,0.896,0.106
"By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was more room to play.",0.230,0.760,0.707,0.950,0.960,0.086
"There was an enormous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing.",0.539,0.129,0.741,0.678,0.980,0.143
"The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin.",0.143,0.129,0.299,0.876,0.992,0.074
"There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once.",0.056,0.086,0.926,0.337,0.990,0.045
"Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.",0.428,0.157,0.946,0.985,0.965,0.067
"It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances.",0.355,0.825,0.909,0.570,0.978,0.357
"But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell.",0.931,0.263,0.927,0.861,0.977,0.438
"It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.",0.810,0.445,0.870,0.833,0.897,0.398

"Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin.",0.611,0.746,0.875,0.986,0.915,0.167
"There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself.",0.343,0.356,0.942,0.908,0.960,0.549
"Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.",0.146,0.937,0.457,0.983,0.729,0.081
"I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do.",0.017,0.923,0.874,0.061,0.492,0.080
"Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground.",0.526,0.553,0.947,0.292,0.976,0.530

"You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feel stodgy, which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best",0.218,0.205,0.953,0.942,0.937,0.168
thing being to talk about it.,0.240,0.522,0.458,0.393,0.238,0.273
Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder.,0.226,0.494,0.814,0.539,0.593,0.077
"Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.",0.464,0.449,0.089,0.229,0.919,0.067
Wendy's favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all gone to bed.,0.417,0.265,0.491,0.590,0.964,0.363
"Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.",0.474,0.282,0.174,0.953,0.930,0.249
"When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, Oh dear, I am sure I sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!",0.117,0.735,0.773,0.923,0.838,0.169
Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.,0.135,0.484,0.388,0.628,0.576,0.292

"Well, it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each other's arms.",0.080,0.272,0.267,0.116,0.068,0.219
After that it followed her about everywhere.,0.923,0.170,0.182,0.878,0.630,0.483
As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her?,0.229,0.478,0.517,0.908,0.163,0.222
"This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland.",0.670,0.799,0.431,0.963,0.595,0.573
"But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind.",0.555,0.669,0.566,0.883,0.838,0.141
"What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.",0.467,0.374,0.940,0.875,0.995,0.033

They were the most ordinary questions What was the colour of Mother's eyes?,0.806,0.134,0.771,0.113,0.952,0.239
"Which was taller, Father or Mother?",0.367,0.305,0.981,0.457,0.935,0.281

"Of course the only boy who replied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: a melancholy thing.",0.714,0.525,0.584,0.835,0.788,0.309
Peter did not compete.,0.044,0.309,0.884,0.295,0.856,0.263
"For one thing he despised all mothers except Wendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write nor spell; not the smallest word.",0.163,0.883,0.501,0.863,0.538,0.117
He was above all that sort of thing.,0.272,0.084,0.901,0.526,0.914,0.102
"By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense.",0.529,0.491,0.684,0.785,0.884,0.056
"What was the colour of Mother's eyes, and so on.",0.508,0.135,0.746,0.616,0.879,0.513
"Wendy, you see, had been forgetting, too.",0.933,0.546,0.064,0.197,0.374,0.407
"Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games.",0.568,0.265,0.989,0.659,0.742,0.090
"It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly.",0.577,0.968,0.662,0.932,0.496,0.136
"To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do.",0.034,0.402,0.939,0.433,0.959,0.027
He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health.,0.725,0.568,0.685,0.044,0.144,0.162
For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would have treated them severely.,0.194,0.608,0.978,0.893,0.458,0.194
"He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not.",0.106,0.521,0.846,0.387,0.874,0.233
"He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body.",0.115,0.719,0.659,0.869,0.339,0.365
"Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale.",0.145,0.334,0.368,0.754,0.561,0.300
"But she was never quite sure, you know.",0.550,0.324,0.898,0.332,0.893,0.164
"There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true.",0.448,0.712,0.745,0.749,0.997,0.014
"To describe them all would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island.",0.150,0.863,0.543,0.962,0.756,0.338
The difficulty is which one to choose.,0.295,0.343,0.342,0.942,0.385,0.290
Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch?,0.301,0.911,0.714,0.970,0.997,0.008
"It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides.",0.168,0.172,0.993,0.857,0.904,0.305
"At the Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out, I'm redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?",0.423,0.424,0.898,0.746,0.988,0.033
"And Tootles answered, Redskin; what are you, Nibs?",0.239,0.914,0.791,0.785,0.929,0.109
"and Nibs said, Redskin; what are you Twin?",0.901,0.921,0.835,0.752,0.924,0.096
"and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.",0.256,0.816,0.046,0.578,0.990,0.047
The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was but we have not decided yet that this is the adventure we are to narrate.,0.109,0.830,0.737,0.763,0.937,0.828
"Perhaps a better one would be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks.",0.101,0.505,0.614,0.919,0.871,0.607
"Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily's life in the Mermaids' Lagoon, and so made her his ally.",0.285,0.810,0.355,0.171,0.130,0.306
"Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a",0.587,0.147,0.239,0.969,0.632,0.303
"stone, and was used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.",0.213,0.292,0.909,0.531,0.911,0.207
"Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter's friends, particularly of the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed.",0.338,0.180,0.786,0.407,0.902,0.167
"That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one.",0.478,0.828,0.693,0.899,0.882,0.292
"A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland.",0.350,0.809,0.825,0.931,0.430,0.428
"Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back.",0.689,0.752,0.602,0.879,0.971,0.196
"Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.",0.809,0.706,0.252,0.414,0.104,0.340
Which of these adventures shall we choose?,0.644,0.991,0.164,0.660,0.555,0.299
The best way will be to toss for it.,0.069,0.079,0.575,0.428,0.496,0.360
"I have tossed, and the lagoon has won.",0.181,0.790,0.415,0.746,0.040,0.484
This almost makes one wish that the gulch or the cake or Tink's leaf had won.,0.392,0.085,0.662,0.821,0.179,0.365
"Of course I could do it again, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon.",0.047,0.068,0.509,0.890,0.308,0.313
"If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.",0.162,0.084,0.691,0.016,0.909,0.419
But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon.,0.166,0.013,0.572,0.124,0.641,0.385
"This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.",0.071,0.497,0.353,0.916,0.506,0.113
"The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth.",0.570,0.042,0.900,0.855,0.266,0.222
"You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them.",0.669,0.287,0.712,0.732,0.970,0.246
"When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but",0.096,0.679,0.701,0.578,0.873,0.181
"then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.",0.811,0.877,0.523,0.780,0.917,0.086
"They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky.",0.196,0.284,0.587,0.414,0.660,0.182
He gave Wendy one of their combs.,0.492,0.439,0.347,0.832,0.047,0.171
"The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course",0.740,0.217,0.863,0.875,0.778,0.197
"Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.",0.343,0.320,0.976,0.814,0.227,0.255
"She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles.",0.402,0.060,0.407,0.452,0.983,0.024
"The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst.",0.911,0.671,0.493,0.537,0.889,0.184
"The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands.",0.892,0.789,0.300,0.820,0.991,0.008
"Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.",0.061,0.263,0.988,0.781,0.982,0.050
"But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared.",0.095,0.526,0.738,0.266,0.612,0.084
"Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it.",0.540,0.776,0.940,0.603,0.985,0.196
This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.,0.177,0.688,0.465,0.939,0.571,0.264
It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal.,0.353,0.233,0.382,0.552,0.912,0.099
"Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe.",0.427,0.578,0.503,0.413,0.633,0.141
"So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.",0.112,0.776,0.386,0.287,0.537,0.045
"It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock.",0.188,0.072,0.938,0.612,0.976,0.054
"The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking.",0.066,0.298,0.886,0.968,0.989,0.024
"She was very busy, stitching.",0.454,0.500,0.474,0.153,0.957,0.116
While she stitched a change came to the lagoon.,0.192,0.680,0.310,0.253,0.262,0.344

"Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly.",0.356,0.462,0.908,0.936,0.065,0.197
"It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night had come.",0.333,0.449,0.940,0.753,0.373,0.185
"No, worse than that.",0.068,0.814,0.073,0.706,0.072,0.451
"It had not come, but it had sent that shiver through the sea to say that it was coming.",0.612,0.317,0.752,0.453,0.939,0.157
What was it?,0.084,0.066,0.879,0.326,0.987,0.109
"There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners' Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown.",0.323,0.857,0.125,0.982,0.349,0.368
"They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.",0.268,0.791,0.772,0.978,0.486,0.238
"Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly.",0.291,0.252,0.648,0.801,0.988,0.030
But she was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal.,0.609,0.474,0.936,0.787,0.975,0.084
"So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not waken them.",0.048,0.867,0.809,0.696,0.285,0.182
"Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them.",0.109,0.693,0.701,0.510,0.910,0.230
She stood over them to let them have their sleep out.,0.776,0.379,0.027,0.332,0.408,0.135
Was it not brave of Wendy?,0.068,0.631,0.954,0.337,0.860,0.145
It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniff danger even in his sleep.,0.166,0.568,0.987,0.450,0.910,0.335
"Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.",0.081,0.300,0.812,0.825,0.968,0.015
"He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.",0.511,0.742,0.310,0.688,0.052,0.390
The others came closer to him.,0.107,0.549,0.058,0.617,0.045,0.783
"A strange smile was playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered.",0.176,0.652,0.922,0.766,0.835,0.166
While that smile was on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand ready to obey.,0.373,0.188,0.994,0.685,0.930,0.100
The order came sharp and incisive.,0.462,0.520,0.580,0.850,0.586,0.441
"There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.",0.198,0.262,0.992,0.756,0.878,0.149
Marooners' Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itself marooned.,0.213,0.442,0.218,0.965,0.970,0.021
The boat drew nearer.,0.093,0.649,0.636,0.870,0.032,0.326
"It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily.",0.177,0.387,0.774,0.633,0.559,0.544
"Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate.",0.716,0.536,0.387,0.894,0.987,0.105
"She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy hunting-ground?",0.120,0.406,0.833,0.873,0.504,0.143
"Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief's daughter, it is enough.",0.114,0.301,0.873,0.993,0.976,0.221
They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.,0.732,0.332,0.005,0.494,0.499,0.363
"No watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook's boast that the wind of his name guarded the ship for a mile around.",0.767,0.521,0.337,0.234,0.948,0.045
Now her fate would help to guard it also.,0.027,0.960,0.274,0.596,0.681,0.117
One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.,0.294,0.583,0.421,0.723,0.779,0.330
In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rock till they crashed into it.,0.193,0.724,0.531,0.194,0.852,0.176
"Luff, you lubber, cried an Irish voice that was Smee's; here's the rock.",0.294,0.315,0.182,0.359,0.818,0.296
"Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and leave her here to drown.",0.507,0.890,0.918,0.883,0.775,0.224
It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.,0.757,0.354,0.615,0.745,0.631,0.049
"Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down, Peter's and Wendy's.",0.700,0.782,0.408,0.907,0.981,0.529
"Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedy she had seen.",0.200,0.257,0.841,0.658,0.912,0.089
"Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all.",0.082,0.201,0.943,0.255,0.105,0.469
"He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angered him, and he meant to save her.",0.193,0.305,0.982,0.878,0.841,0.268
"An easy way would have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.",0.553,0.570,0.685,0.162,0.958,0.172
"There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice of Hook.",0.352,0.860,0.022,0.724,0.886,0.078
"Ahoy there, you lubbers!",0.373,0.447,0.021,0.431,0.306,0.305
It was a marvellous imitation.,0.692,0.159,0.933,0.410,0.939,0.217
"The captain! said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.",0.896,0.752,0.065,0.608,0.989,0.022
"He must be swimming out to us, Starkey said, when they had looked for him in vain.",0.440,0.363,0.782,0.301,0.557,0.082
"We are putting the redskin on the rock, Smee called out.",0.902,0.869,0.506,0.833,0.736,0.223
"Set her free, came the astonishing answer.",0.781,0.352,0.649,0.277,0.512,0.134
"Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.",0.152,0.274,0.021,0.631,0.525,0.817
"At once, d'ye hear, cried Peter, or I'll plunge my hook in you.",0.177,0.009,0.101,0.095,0.991,0.032
This is queer!,0.463,0.806,0.154,0.966,0.308,0.488
"Better do what the captain orders, said Starkey nervously.",0.866,0.082,0.499,0.297,0.752,0.084
"Ay, ay, Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily's cords.",0.045,0.118,0.402,0.676,0.186,0.761
At once like an eel she slid between Starkey's legs into the water.,0.042,0.702,0.383,0.425,0.995,0.015
"Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter's cleverness; but she knew that he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth.",0.268,0.936,0.638,0.802,0.975,0.080
"But it was stayed even in the act, for Boat ahoy!",0.411,0.451,0.694,0.794,0.735,0.187
"rang over the lagoon in Hook's voice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.",0.571,0.009,0.377,0.298,0.781,0.509
"Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead.",0.599,0.335,0.840,0.217,0.335,0.523
Boat ahoy! again came the voice.,0.251,0.467,0.001,0.754,0.120,0.452
Now Wendy understood.,0.071,0.920,0.027,0.146,0.356,0.263
The real Hook was also in the water.,0.450,0.141,0.747,0.119,0.923,0.398
"He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he had soon reached them.",0.485,0.282,0.885,0.665,0.687,0.130
"In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook grip the boat's side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but Peter would not budge.",0.459,0.646,0.386,0.525,0.363,0.445
He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit.,0.038,0.180,0.854,0.688,0.820,0.059
"Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!",0.322,0.829,0.298,0.146,0.079,0.243
"he whispered to her, and though she thought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no one heard him except herself.",0.431,0.820,0.851,0.962,0.508,0.482
He signed to her to listen.,0.323,0.454,0.984,0.681,0.089,0.366
"The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain to them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound melancholy.",0.674,0.833,0.077,0.281,0.899,0.193
"Captain, is all well?",0.150,0.726,0.058,0.657,0.108,0.449
"they asked timidly, but he answered with a hollow moan.",0.132,0.049,0.252,0.497,0.250,0.136
"He sighs, said Smee.",0.341,0.448,0.536,0.718,0.011,0.140
"He sighs again, said Starkey.",0.302,0.537,0.563,0.768,0.055,0.245
"And yet a third time he sighs, said Smee.",0.604,0.566,0.119,0.577,0.282,0.180
Then at last he spoke passionately.,0.831,0.515,0.151,0.517,0.992,0.005
"The game's up, he cried, those boys have found a mother.",0.562,0.085,0.127,0.333,0.097,0.468
"Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.",0.413,0.310,0.629,0.145,0.739,0.031
O evil day! cried Starkey.,0.736,0.389,0.764,0.249,0.132,0.415
What's a mother? asked the ignorant Smee.,0.678,0.531,0.257,0.646,0.022,0.051
Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed.,0.086,0.632,0.978,0.311,0.886,0.128
He doesn't know!,0.428,0.320,0.026,0.771,0.175,0.199
and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be her one.,0.257,0.547,0.470,0.799,0.276,0.297
"Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying, What was that?",0.577,0.040,0.900,0.190,0.964,0.188
"I heard nothing, said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight.",0.916,0.247,0.691,0.450,0.907,0.316
"It was the nest I have told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it.",0.040,0.224,0.978,0.763,0.838,0.340
"See, said Hook in answer to Smee's question, that is a mother.",0.695,0.842,0.419,0.739,0.114,0.473
What a lesson!,0.594,0.088,0.686,0.623,0.896,0.239
"The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother desert her eggs?",0.029,0.897,0.883,0.215,0.242,0.314
"There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent days when but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.",0.447,0.552,0.387,0.658,0.810,0.124
"Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but the more suspicious Starkey said, If she is a mother, perhaps she is hanging about here to help Peter.",0.225,0.377,0.377,0.798,0.971,0.037
"Ay, he said, that is the fear that haunts me.",0.781,0.670,0.326,0.457,0.026,0.573
He was roused from this dejection by Smee's eager voice.,0.384,0.003,0.004,0.531,0.946,0.253
"Captain, said Smee, could we not kidnap these boys' mother and make her our mother?",0.340,0.843,0.186,0.860,0.049,0.280
"It is a princely scheme, cried Hook, and at once it took practical shape in his great brain.",0.037,0.391,0.529,0.493,0.984,0.070
"We will seize the children and carry them to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our mother.",0.636,0.923,0.478,0.542,0.299,0.358
Again Wendy forgot herself.,0.028,0.629,0.205,0.935,0.115,0.758
"she cried, and bobbed.",0.098,0.398,0.049,0.440,0.220,0.144
What was that?,0.480,0.055,0.933,0.436,0.987,0.099
But they could see nothing.,0.015,0.104,0.871,0.858,0.461,0.276
They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind.,0.409,0.572,0.080,0.655,0.939,0.341
"Do you agree, my bullies? asked Hook.",0.259,0.240,0.840,0.184,0.489,0.059
"There is my hand on it, they both said.",0.491,0.669,0.198,0.789,0.405,0.422
And there is my hook.,0.577,0.918,0.137,0.722,0.515,0.284
They all swore.,0.026,0.002,0.799,0.870,0.715,0.316
"By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook remembered Tiger Lily.",0.173,0.164,0.252,0.843,0.787,0.259
Where is the redskin?,0.199,0.581,0.168,0.972,0.444,0.373
he demanded abruptly.,0.040,0.127,0.061,0.713,0.089,0.089
"He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the moments.",0.252,0.419,0.400,0.968,0.998,0.016
"That is all right, captain, Smee answered complacently; we let her go.",0.844,0.933,0.017,0.714,0.160,0.301
Let her go! cried Hook.,0.561,0.200,0.030,0.428,0.374,0.289
"'Twas your own orders, the bo'sun faltered.",0.202,0.890,0.239,0.517,0.496,0.107
"You called over the water to us to let her go, said Starkey.",0.808,0.274,0.212,0.413,0.850,0.318
"Brimstone and gall, thundered Hook, what cozening is going on here!",0.645,0.347,0.479,0.982,0.905,0.136
"His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they believed their words, and he was startled.",0.721,0.324,0.722,0.621,0.957,0.082
"Lads, he said, shaking a little, I gave no such order.",0.551,0.532,0.811,0.249,0.008,0.049
"It is passing queer, Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.",0.703,0.070,0.955,0.801,0.805,0.215
"Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.",0.278,0.161,0.603,0.465,0.969,0.323
"Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night, he cried, dost hear me?",0.101,0.498,0.404,0.525,0.189,0.218
"Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not.",0.626,0.232,0.757,0.209,0.806,0.074
He immediately answered in Hook's voice:,0.549,0.306,0.003,0.735,0.144,0.461
"Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.",0.351,0.498,0.132,0.542,0.266,0.230
"In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee and Starkey clung to each other in terror.",0.427,0.745,0.865,0.280,0.989,0.077
"Who are you, stranger?",0.910,0.053,0.376,0.283,0.492,0.572
"I am James Hook, replied the voice, captain of the Jolly Roger.",0.295,0.113,0.004,0.692,0.155,0.517
"You are not; you are not, Hook cried hoarsely.",0.872,0.740,0.262,0.244,0.897,0.086
"Brimstone and gall, the voice retorted, say that again, and I'll cast anchor in you.",0.890,0.237,0.018,0.831,0.379,0.459
Hook tried a more ingratiating manner.,0.801,0.117,0.393,0.153,0.605,0.225
"If you are Hook, he said almost humbly, come tell me, who am I?",0.416,0.672,0.274,0.485,0.380,0.259
"A codfish, replied the voice, only a codfish.",0.594,0.093,0.027,0.277,0.688,0.435
"Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then, that his proud spirit broke.",0.761,0.513,0.965,0.693,0.446,0.197
He saw his men draw back from him.,0.396,0.796,0.682,0.210,0.671,0.197
Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!,0.623,0.884,0.350,0.602,0.520,0.316
It is lowering to our pride.,0.258,0.018,0.062,0.868,0.053,0.510
"They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had become, he scarcely heeded them.",0.648,0.673,0.152,0.482,0.991,0.043
"Against such fearful evidence it was not their belief in him that he needed, it was his own.",0.150,0.589,0.813,0.461,0.974,0.145
He felt his ego slipping from him.,0.193,0.215,0.336,0.228,0.112,0.318
"Don't desert me, bully, he whispered hoarsely to it.",0.271,0.237,0.089,0.404,0.069,0.376
"In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the great pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions.",0.110,0.543,0.975,0.738,0.880,0.317
Suddenly he tried the guessing game.,0.457,0.303,0.087,0.530,0.099,0.212
"Hook, he called, have you another voice?",0.652,0.026,0.002,0.202,0.286,0.308
"Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own voice, I have.",0.231,0.815,0.015,0.166,0.437,0.407
And another name?,0.278,0.235,0.170,0.380,0.359,0.120
Vegetable? asked Hook.,0.811,0.908,0.306,0.635,0.104,0.151
This answer rang out scornfully.,0.439,0.055,0.632,0.654,0.333,0.337
To Wendy's pain the answer that rang out this time was Yes.,0.472,0.102,0.819,0.333,0.928,0.699
Are you in England?,0.000,0.796,0.343,0.359,0.733,0.145
Are you here?,0.613,0.460,0.150,0.282,0.615,0.168
Hook was completely puzzled.,0.836,0.257,0.916,0.392,0.894,0.260
"You ask him some questions, he said to the others, wiping his damp brow.",0.699,0.757,0.644,0.126,0.227,0.272
"I can't think of a thing, he said regretfully.",0.257,0.292,0.436,0.465,0.207,0.308
"Can't guess, can't guess!",0.053,0.544,0.413,0.306,0.012,0.033
Do you give it up?,0.135,0.352,0.378,0.442,0.563,0.030
"Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the miscreants saw their chance.",0.388,0.566,0.001,0.303,0.849,0.349
"Yes, yes, they answered eagerly.",0.633,0.038,0.638,0.128,0.794,0.277
"Well, then, he cried, I am Peter Pan.",0.596,0.392,0.701,0.015,0.091,0.336
"In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his faithful henchmen.",0.167,0.803,0.988,0.218,0.958,0.106
"Now we have him, Hook shouted.",0.268,0.916,0.560,0.199,0.609,0.253
"Into the water, Smee.",0.630,0.430,0.795,0.106,0.087,0.729
"Starkey, mind the boat.",0.501,0.665,0.474,0.844,0.064,0.300
Take him dead or alive!,0.075,0.138,0.730,0.744,0.077,0.167

"Ay, ay, from various parts of the lagoon.",0.141,0.019,0.220,0.406,0.008,0.825
Then lam into the pirates.,0.979,0.885,0.058,0.344,0.225,0.292
The fight was short and sharp.,0.536,0.433,0.891,0.899,0.961,0.232
"First to draw blood was John, who gallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey.",0.457,0.538,0.980,0.181,0.597,0.327
"There was fierce struggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate's grasp.",0.650,0.027,0.614,0.578,0.970,0.089
He wriggled overboard and John leapt after him.,0.286,0.126,0.154,0.685,0.275,0.332
The dinghy drifted away.,0.232,0.405,0.152,0.590,0.142,0.413
"Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steel followed by a cry or a whoop.",0.170,0.081,0.980,0.672,0.977,0.169
In the confusion some struck at their own side.,0.506,0.064,0.031,0.200,0.996,0.016
"The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he was himself pinked in turn by Curly.",0.603,0.087,0.967,0.800,0.941,0.069
Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.,0.354,0.283,0.874,0.744,0.942,0.179
Where all this time was Peter?,0.303,0.056,0.873,0.054,0.952,0.396
He was seeking bigger game.,0.038,0.002,0.555,0.972,0.776,0.430
"The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing from the pirate captain.",0.106,0.782,0.201,0.319,0.885,0.318
"His iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.",0.085,0.274,0.659,0.789,0.911,0.231
But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter that circle.,0.817,0.168,0.988,0.651,0.976,0.194
"Strangely, it was not in the water that they met.",0.350,0.841,0.853,0.262,0.930,0.275
"Hook rose to the rock to breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side.",0.314,0.462,0.429,0.404,0.972,0.039
"The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb.",0.118,0.039,0.348,0.703,0.639,0.305
Neither knew that the other was coming.,0.361,0.723,0.644,0.664,0.834,0.043
Each feeling for a grip met the other's arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so they met.,0.475,0.717,0.942,0.222,0.961,0.239
Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to they had a sinking.,0.877,0.037,0.912,0.800,0.392,0.145
Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it.,0.211,0.140,0.560,0.158,0.995,0.028
"After all, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared.",0.825,0.191,0.474,0.247,0.944,0.314
"But Peter had no sinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy.",0.050,0.138,0.937,0.691,0.137,0.341
"Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook's belt and was about to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe.",0.236,0.692,0.894,0.887,0.859,0.293
It would not have been fighting fair.,0.612,0.334,0.417,0.430,0.218,0.283
He gave the pirate a hand to help him up.,0.468,0.583,0.098,0.196,0.051,0.501
It was then that Hook bit him.,0.509,0.143,0.690,0.076,0.964,0.181
Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter.,0.571,0.296,0.848,0.044,0.886,0.352
It made him quite helpless.,0.447,0.085,0.267,0.015,0.131,0.376
"He could only stare, horrified.",0.197,0.067,0.904,0.310,0.056,0.170
Every child is affected thus the first time he is treated unfairly.,0.653,0.726,0.982,0.992,0.193,0.209
All he thinks he has a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness.,0.921,0.212,0.543,0.960,0.236,0.098
"After you have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy.",0.595,0.371,0.472,0.158,0.322,0.264
No one ever gets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter.,0.545,0.172,0.548,0.042,0.033,0.113
"He often met it, but he always forgot it.",0.030,0.387,0.700,0.582,0.019,0.368
I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest.,0.840,0.574,0.734,0.545,0.890,0.262
"So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just stare, helpless.",0.273,0.087,0.635,0.336,0.938,0.104
Twice the iron hand clawed him.,0.246,0.470,0.461,0.741,0.309,0.622
"A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him.",0.154,0.621,0.974,0.086,0.962,0.261
"On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name.",0.404,0.536,0.243,0.598,0.973,0.052
"They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting Peter, Wendy as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.",0.729,0.668,0.770,0.813,0.882,0.269
"They must be swimming back or flying, the boys concluded.",0.219,0.313,0.260,0.037,0.805,0.124

"They chuckled, boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all mother Wendy's fault!",0.144,0.281,0.725,0.817,0.981,0.375
"When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then a feeble cry.",0.142,0.282,0.492,0.454,0.867,0.104
Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and lay on the boy's arm.,0.312,0.762,0.271,0.327,0.892,0.113
With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock and then lay down beside her.,0.172,0.069,0.318,0.116,0.242,0.386
Even as he also fainted he saw that the water was rising.,0.223,0.470,0.183,0.073,0.694,0.345

"Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back.",0.311,0.478,0.834,0.071,0.934,0.234
But he had to tell her the truth.,0.305,0.493,0.542,0.519,0.317,0.241
"We are on the rock, Wendy, he said, but it is growing smaller.",0.651,0.762,0.906,0.882,0.279,0.648
Soon the water will be over it.,0.087,0.557,0.300,0.317,0.335,0.369
She did not understand even now.,0.304,0.600,0.093,0.153,0.815,0.368
"We must go, she said, almost brightly.",0.308,0.960,0.226,0.524,0.181,0.342
"Yes, he answered faintly.",0.528,0.628,0.687,0.695,0.109,0.246
"Shall we swim or fly, Peter?",0.884,0.810,0.628,0.077,0.431,0.306
He had to tell her.,0.656,0.362,0.321,0.407,0.048,0.226
"Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without my help?",0.180,0.829,0.059,0.762,0.341,0.074
She had to admit that she was too tired.,0.399,0.097,0.198,0.250,0.850,0.192
What is it?,0.276,0.570,0.422,0.775,0.914,0.214
"she asked, anxious about him at once.",0.047,0.547,0.187,0.368,0.988,0.004
"I can't help you, Wendy.",0.112,0.718,0.137,0.335,0.091,0.324
Hook wounded me.,0.663,0.175,0.441,0.596,0.236,0.319
I can neither fly nor swim.,0.772,0.854,0.207,0.604,0.824,0.195
Do you mean we shall both be drowned?,0.371,0.978,0.603,0.786,0.750,0.080
Look how the water is rising.,0.576,0.502,0.290,0.878,0.504,0.496
They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight.,0.839,0.373,0.382,0.276,0.922,0.447
They thought they would soon be no more.,0.018,0.390,0.267,0.471,0.951,0.033
"As they sat thus something brushed against Peter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, Can I be of any use?",0.129,0.419,0.458,0.951,0.673,0.134
"It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before.",0.790,0.013,0.689,0.120,0.780,0.496
It had torn itself out of his hand and floated away.,0.802,0.779,0.200,0.934,0.119,0.687
"Michael's kite, Peter said without interest, but next moment he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.",0.676,0.247,0.737,0.133,0.895,0.248
"It lifted Michael off the ground, he cried; why should it not carry you?",0.092,0.406,0.353,0.297,0.066,0.136
Both of us!,0.825,0.833,0.013,0.644,0.930,0.042
It can't lift two; Michael and Curly tried.,0.237,0.139,0.039,0.461,0.800,0.236
"Let us draw lots, Wendy said bravely.",0.841,0.609,0.003,0.586,0.923,0.072
And you a lady; never.,0.631,0.227,0.219,0.670,0.470,0.289
Already he had tied the tail round her.,0.543,0.422,0.005,0.479,0.041,0.643
"She clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a Good-bye, Wendy, he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne out of his sight.",0.784,0.810,0.605,0.409,0.955,0.119
Peter was alone on the lagoon.,0.167,0.028,0.721,0.177,0.980,0.023
The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged.,0.349,0.731,0.789,0.085,0.955,0.045
Pale rays of light tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling to the moon.,0.124,0.306,0.804,0.969,0.986,0.084
Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last.,0.471,0.036,0.791,0.232,0.997,0.011
"A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one.",0.189,0.259,0.924,0.184,0.928,0.223
"Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him.",0.157,0.703,0.595,0.097,0.433,0.266
"It was saying, To die will be an awfully big adventure.",0.463,0.286,0.907,0.149,0.972,0.489
The last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids retiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea.,0.426,0.408,0.721,0.312,0.988,0.026
"He was too far away to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.",0.884,0.361,0.545,0.847,0.126,0.739
"Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon.",0.676,0.152,0.371,0.209,0.994,0.013
"He thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.",0.588,0.498,0.490,0.857,0.850,0.188
"Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon the lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.",0.407,0.215,0.753,0.831,0.844,0.376
"It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest.",0.089,0.437,0.993,0.674,0.973,0.344
"By working her wings, in a way she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was very exhausted.",0.194,0.537,0.946,0.651,0.926,0.178
"She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there were eggs in it.",0.036,0.934,0.985,0.412,0.874,0.098
"I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her.",0.335,0.521,0.579,0.664,0.990,0.028
"I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.",0.772,0.436,0.534,0.775,0.928,0.804
"She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other's language.",0.269,0.163,0.614,0.473,0.664,0.084
"In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened.",0.069,0.523,0.368,0.878,0.861,0.079
"Well, not only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their manners.",0.110,0.729,0.630,0.249,0.167,0.201
"I want you to get into the nest, the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible, and then you can drift ashore, but I am too tired to bring it any nearer",0.466,0.867,0.869,0.909,0.140,0.225
so you must try to swim to it.,0.673,0.340,0.386,0.428,0.390,0.322
What are you quacking about?,0.681,0.576,0.541,0.658,0.961,0.081
Why don't you let the nest drift as usual?,0.134,0.757,0.917,0.798,0.065,0.396
I want you,0.416,0.083,0.074,0.535,0.017,0.366
"the bird said, and repeated it all over.",0.644,0.476,0.849,0.308,0.423,0.585
Then Peter tried slow and distinct.,0.747,0.075,0.277,0.238,0.460,0.244
What are you quacking about? and so on.,0.676,0.610,0.581,0.770,0.936,0.109
The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.,0.553,0.119,0.778,0.070,0.580,0.227
You dunderheaded little jay!,0.543,0.345,0.468,0.196,0.004,0.232
"she screamed, Why don't you do as I tell you?",0.405,0.596,0.069,0.096,0.242,0.046
"Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly:",0.654,0.612,0.689,0.267,0.990,0.009
So are you!,0.781,0.695,0.188,0.236,0.711,0.128
Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:,0.596,0.886,0.286,0.485,0.854,0.249
"Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock.",0.075,0.516,0.985,0.969,0.773,0.300
"Then up she flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.",0.177,0.807,0.569,0.403,0.296,0.083
"Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead.",0.330,0.798,0.904,0.364,0.983,0.033
"It was not to receive his thanks, however, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.",0.698,0.516,0.997,0.791,0.971,0.067
"There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected.",0.697,0.284,0.502,0.271,0.964,0.093
"The bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.",0.232,0.875,0.102,0.863,0.257,0.149
"I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure.",0.339,0.297,0.604,0.880,0.814,0.200
"The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon them.",0.869,0.088,0.954,0.658,0.945,0.087
"The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.",0.166,0.485,0.948,0.814,0.847,0.257
Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon.,0.736,0.025,0.814,0.510,0.714,0.312
It floated beautifully.,0.045,0.213,0.029,0.315,0.157,0.457
"The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her.",0.630,0.092,0.553,0.121,0.994,0.018
"Then he got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail.",0.739,0.814,0.989,0.444,0.884,0.076
At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on her eggs.,0.202,0.661,0.233,0.662,0.975,0.020
"She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both cheering.",0.362,0.503,0.267,0.568,0.953,0.133
Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandoned the nest.,0.298,0.578,0.965,0.756,0.886,0.158
"It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sitting on his hat.",0.209,0.817,0.385,0.934,0.336,0.396
"As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an airing.",0.116,0.759,0.963,0.346,0.315,0.349
"Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite.",0.733,0.358,0.671,0.866,0.852,0.306
Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed.,0.061,0.027,0.795,0.496,0.977,0.246
"This so inflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, To bed, to bed, in a voice that had to be obeyed.",0.525,0.292,0.201,0.907,0.929,0.328
"Next day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings.",0.850,0.860,0.844,0.922,0.991,0.076
One important result of the brush on the lagoon was that it made the redskins their friends.,0.350,0.381,0.873,0.664,0.936,0.313

"So uproariously gay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it!",0.226,0.327,0.375,0.652,0.791,0.231

"So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.",0.717,0.713,0.321,0.930,0.892,0.441

"Intently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void.",0.383,0.822,0.963,0.910,0.800,0.120
"Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly's tree, with his dagger in his hand?",0.478,0.542,0.882,0.572,0.993,0.160
"There was no way of knowing, save by going down.",0.035,0.121,0.987,0.928,0.948,0.239
"Hook let his cloak slip softly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, he stepped into the tree.",0.669,0.322,0.705,0.864,0.209,0.225
"He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle.",0.423,0.198,0.987,0.790,0.980,0.115
"Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.",0.621,0.446,0.259,0.107,0.360,0.221
"He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, biting at his breath, which had almost left him.",0.349,0.363,0.824,0.807,0.992,0.009
"As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was the great bed.",0.592,0.115,0.976,0.769,0.993,0.035
On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.,0.017,0.692,0.496,0.041,0.172,0.404
"Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care.",0.186,0.204,0.988,0.491,0.917,0.207
"Then he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy.",0.823,0.825,0.096,0.118,0.023,0.876
"Then he lay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn of the night.",0.552,0.528,0.205,0.852,0.991,0.031
Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.,0.394,0.430,0.049,0.244,0.385,0.110
"Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than the dreams of other boys.",0.037,0.663,0.311,0.021,0.556,0.069
"For hours he could not be separated from these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them.",0.195,0.611,0.563,0.701,0.088,0.187
"They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence.",0.163,0.794,0.955,0.264,0.419,0.043
"At such times it had been Wendy's custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should not know of the indignity",0.395,0.859,0.969,0.918,0.335,0.359
to which she had subjected him.,0.153,0.443,0.178,0.638,0.488,0.383
But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep.,0.288,0.527,0.325,0.519,0.987,0.007
"One arm dropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little pearls.",0.749,0.340,0.984,0.939,0.924,0.288
Thus defenceless Hook found him.,0.367,0.018,0.430,0.844,0.440,0.622
He stood silent at the foot of the tree looking across the chamber at his enemy.,0.087,0.196,0.966,0.808,0.988,0.003
Did no feeling of compassion disturb his sombre breast?,0.375,0.461,0.213,0.341,0.768,0.279
"The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred him profoundly.",0.428,0.197,0.875,0.952,0.790,0.270
"Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.",0.512,0.683,0.890,0.578,0.370,0.156
What stayed him was Peter's impertinent appearance as he slept.,0.414,0.058,0.843,0.810,0.870,0.048
"The open mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness.",0.552,0.298,0.718,0.779,0.912,0.472
They steeled Hook's heart.,0.015,0.010,0.473,0.520,0.599,0.030
"If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.",0.467,0.776,0.971,0.729,0.980,0.067
"Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, the door of Slightly's tree.",0.826,0.810,0.654,0.609,0.957,0.050
"It did not entirely fill the aperture, and he had been looking over it.",0.242,0.683,0.853,0.553,0.415,0.287
"Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach.",0.364,0.347,0.887,0.201,0.932,0.247
"To his disordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter's face and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung himself against it.",0.429,0.854,0.959,0.497,0.269,0.773
Was his enemy to escape him after all?,0.115,0.152,0.813,0.147,0.914,0.208
But what was that?,0.466,0.078,0.960,0.724,0.985,0.097
The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter's medicine standing on a ledge within easy reach.,0.564,0.922,0.428,0.596,0.936,0.835
"He fathomed what it was straightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.",0.360,0.492,0.793,0.889,0.970,0.176
"Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into his possession.",0.714,0.671,0.990,0.835,0.071,0.379
"These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.",0.132,0.798,0.643,0.492,0.500,0.081
Five drops of this he now added to Peter's cup.,0.674,0.864,0.064,0.208,0.932,0.789
"His hand shook, but it was in exultation rather than in shame.",0.131,0.367,0.778,0.538,0.881,0.784
"As he did it he avoided glancing at the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling.",0.236,0.680,0.905,0.995,0.967,0.039
"Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree.",0.792,0.396,0.983,0.696,0.215,0.309
As he emerged at the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.,0.732,0.482,0.627,0.366,0.784,0.014
"Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself, stole away through the trees.",0.549,0.653,0.992,0.943,0.849,0.410
Peter slept on.,0.069,0.175,0.586,0.317,0.247,0.451
"The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept.",0.859,0.592,0.539,0.075,0.198,0.367
"It must have been not less than ten o'clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew not what.",0.543,0.578,0.734,0.712,0.332,0.153
It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.,0.974,0.297,0.743,0.737,0.844,0.384
"Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister.",0.983,0.052,0.607,0.764,0.960,0.221
Peter felt for his dagger till his hand gripped it.,0.114,0.683,0.833,0.103,0.121,0.624
Then he spoke.,0.930,0.676,0.402,0.579,0.311,0.136
Who is that?,0.390,0.323,0.455,0.748,0.018,0.539
For long there was no answer: then again the knock.,0.174,0.120,0.953,0.594,0.817,0.056
Who are you?,0.738,0.135,0.421,0.230,0.489,0.401
"He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled.",0.055,0.235,0.839,0.257,0.643,0.037
In two strides he reached the door.,0.807,0.568,0.151,0.789,0.906,0.360
"Unlike Slightly's door, it filled the aperture, so that he could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.",0.123,0.653,0.809,0.872,0.657,0.456
"I won't open unless you speak, Peter cried.",0.311,0.391,0.346,0.059,0.253,0.119
"Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.",0.827,0.236,0.002,0.501,0.992,0.163
"Let me in, Peter.",0.258,0.071,0.124,0.083,0.143,0.458
"It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her.",0.891,0.549,0.704,0.875,0.791,0.089
"She flew in excitedly, her face flushed and her dress stained with mud.",0.238,0.262,0.759,0.956,0.529,0.426
What is it?,0.276,0.570,0.422,0.775,0.914,0.214
"Oh, you could never guess!",0.196,0.475,0.583,0.167,0.021,0.046
"she cried, and offered him three guesses.",0.178,0.361,0.182,0.595,0.681,0.156
Out with it!,0.522,0.131,0.264,0.262,0.054,0.425
"he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, she told of the capture of Wendy and the boys.",0.019,0.275,0.080,0.059,0.079,0.279
Peter's heart bobbed up and down as he listened.,0.445,0.810,0.913,0.617,0.039,0.109
"Wendy bound, and on the pirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!",0.424,0.801,0.086,0.672,0.101,0.076
I'll rescue her!,0.609,0.430,0.058,0.633,0.387,0.391
"he cried, leaping at his weapons.",0.581,0.918,0.414,0.684,0.990,0.007
As he leapt he thought of something he could do to please her.,0.217,0.563,0.529,0.529,0.135,0.039
He could take his medicine.,0.480,0.706,0.341,0.822,0.013,0.174
His hand closed on the fatal draught.,0.738,0.429,0.749,0.704,0.251,0.741
"No! shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as he sped through the forest.",0.892,0.661,0.737,0.753,0.140,0.732
It is poisoned.,0.503,0.740,0.121,0.937,0.121,0.508
Who could have poisoned it?,0.050,0.051,0.455,0.855,0.023,0.669
Don't be silly.,0.038,0.331,0.556,0.542,0.193,0.735
How could Hook have got down here?,0.821,0.072,0.356,0.488,0.044,0.178
"Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the dark secret of Slightly's tree.",0.364,0.402,0.621,0.312,0.779,0.348
Nevertheless Hook's words had left no room for doubt.,0.699,0.314,0.947,0.969,0.283,0.176
The cup was poisoned.,0.910,0.057,0.813,0.861,0.922,0.894
"Besides, said Peter, quite believing himself, I never fell asleep.",0.556,0.342,0.938,0.050,0.367,0.535
He raised the cup.,0.188,0.188,0.838,0.255,0.035,0.962
"No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained it to the dregs.",0.835,0.741,0.893,0.937,0.219,0.164
"Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?",0.944,0.504,0.278,0.619,0.105,0.180
But she did not answer.,0.124,0.748,0.697,0.676,0.896,0.218
Already she was reeling in the air.,0.206,0.492,0.884,0.086,0.854,0.794
"What is the matter with you? cried Peter, suddenly afraid.",0.408,0.286,0.647,0.811,0.808,0.096
"It was poisoned, Peter, she told him softly; and now I am going to be dead.",0.002,0.252,0.867,0.697,0.970,0.154
"O Tink, did you drink it to save me?",0.286,0.579,0.941,0.896,0.659,0.353
"But why, Tink?",0.123,0.580,0.745,0.910,0.203,0.241
"Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his shoulder and gave his nose a loving bite.",0.118,0.836,0.803,0.576,0.064,0.130
"She whispered in his ear You silly ass, and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.",0.291,0.492,0.672,0.305,0.283,0.264
His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near her in distress.,0.642,0.894,0.113,0.699,0.152,0.235
Every moment her light was growing fainter; and he knew that if it went out she would be no more.,0.122,0.431,0.895,0.502,0.654,0.065
She liked his tears so much that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.,0.048,0.828,0.048,0.934,0.337,0.121
Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.,0.375,0.347,0.738,0.624,0.987,0.021
Then he made it out.,0.289,0.552,0.044,0.126,0.184,0.287
She was saying that she thought she could get well again if children believed in fairies.,0.529,0.532,0.801,0.569,0.938,0.037
Peter flung out his arms.,0.266,0.336,0.787,0.356,0.059,0.782
"There were no children there, and it was night time; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.",0.781,0.837,0.983,0.716,0.412,0.274
Do you believe?,0.593,0.334,0.308,0.145,0.160,0.020
Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.,0.963,0.912,0.752,0.957,0.183,0.284
"She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she wasn't sure.",0.264,0.565,0.072,0.649,0.535,0.189
What do you think?,0.440,0.146,0.487,0.301,0.872,0.012
she asked Peter.,0.239,0.137,0.412,0.015,0.091,0.098
"If you believe, he shouted to them, clap your hands; don't let Tink die.",0.410,0.916,0.003,0.619,0.110,0.296
A few beasts hissed.,0.600,0.075,0.295,0.172,0.343,0.180
The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to their nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved.,0.263,0.263,0.970,0.850,0.854,0.128
"First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever.",0.786,0.790,0.009,0.830,0.612,0.092
"She never thought of thanking those who believed, but she would have liked to get at the ones who had hissed.",0.469,0.235,0.377,0.238,0.992,0.026
And now to rescue Wendy!,0.652,0.800,0.066,0.363,0.518,0.123
"The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirt with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest.",0.824,0.133,0.892,0.431,0.494,0.254
It was not such a night as he would have chosen.,0.693,0.177,0.890,0.251,0.865,0.147
"He had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.",0.833,0.154,0.748,0.739,0.842,0.483
He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange names that they are very wild and difficult of approach.,0.681,0.358,0.156,0.086,0.445,0.155
"There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at which happily he was an adept.",0.171,0.366,0.960,0.338,0.996,0.012
"But in what direction, for he could not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship?",0.655,0.622,0.002,0.713,0.857,0.196
"A light fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of the recent carnage.",0.680,0.534,0.976,0.337,0.341,0.338
"He had taught the children something of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it.",0.160,0.830,0.869,0.919,0.988,0.203
"Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at some important place.",0.730,0.776,0.656,0.390,0.994,0.072
"The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and he could not wait.",0.056,0.530,0.825,0.888,0.812,0.158
"The upper world had called him, but would give no help.",0.179,0.687,0.073,0.374,0.115,0.292
"The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not a movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, or stalking him from behind.",0.238,0.473,0.940,0.868,0.982,0.110
He swore this terrible oath:,0.534,0.016,0.237,0.900,0.097,0.105
Hook or me this time.,0.820,0.270,0.496,0.397,0.398,0.310
"Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across a space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his dagger at the ready.",0.591,0.807,0.970,0.924,0.984,0.023
He was frightfully happy.,0.297,0.043,0.966,0.086,0.911,0.149
"One green light squinting over Kidd's Creek, which is near the mouth of the pirate river, marked where the brig, the Jolly Roger, lay, low in the water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers.",0.046,0.583,0.830,0.888,0.933,0.294
"She was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in the horror of her name.",0.480,0.315,0.949,0.805,0.934,0.117
"She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her could have reached the shore.",0.893,0.103,0.614,0.691,0.927,0.197
"There was little sound, and none agreeable save the whir of the ship's sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee.",0.889,0.145,0.983,0.786,0.991,0.056
"I know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook's tears and made it flow.",0.133,0.173,0.928,0.941,0.980,0.056
"Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.",0.588,0.649,0.842,0.455,0.582,0.185
"A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out",0.119,0.078,0.997,0.831,0.540,0.194
"of Hook's reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing.",0.366,0.384,0.480,0.898,0.446,0.185
Hook trod the deck in thought.,0.732,0.498,0.433,0.370,0.879,0.252
O man unfathomable.,0.678,0.258,0.625,0.217,0.006,0.541
It was his hour of triumph.,0.805,0.568,0.948,0.297,0.909,0.057
"Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank.",0.885,0.776,0.590,0.060,0.926,0.385
"It was his grimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his success?",0.386,0.974,0.583,0.962,0.555,0.287
"But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of his sombre mind.",0.441,0.384,0.950,0.273,0.958,0.088
Hook was profoundly dejected.,0.118,0.055,0.833,0.851,0.941,0.255
He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude of the night.,0.133,0.234,0.311,0.941,0.722,0.117
It was because he was so terribly alone.,0.251,0.091,0.932,0.352,0.983,0.008
This inscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.,0.296,0.890,0.306,0.445,0.511,0.074
They were socially inferior to him.,0.012,0.278,0.516,0.119,0.952,0.056
Hook was not his true name.,0.577,0.241,0.862,0.232,0.893,0.045
"To reveal who he really was would even at this date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned.",0.796,0.539,0.741,0.713,0.975,0.041
"Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress in which he grappled her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school's distinguished slouch.",0.408,0.414,0.295,0.939,0.886,0.349
But above all he retained the passion for good form.,0.830,0.763,0.679,0.365,0.546,0.226

"From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through them came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep.",0.729,0.675,0.186,0.980,0.910,0.486
Have you been good form to-day? was their eternal question.,0.658,0.679,0.885,0.071,0.951,0.342
"Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine, he cried.",0.830,0.802,0.190,0.982,0.593,0.670
Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?,0.358,0.891,0.226,0.734,0.995,0.008
the tap-tap from his school replied.,0.908,0.829,0.007,0.778,0.500,0.491
"I am the only man whom Barbecue feared, he urged, and Flint feared Barbecue.",0.932,0.906,0.563,0.316,0.498,0.288

"Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about good form?",0.139,0.450,0.972,0.079,0.756,0.409

"Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.",0.284,0.054,0.958,0.559,0.872,0.110
"Ah, envy not Hook.",0.925,0.874,0.202,0.161,0.369,0.282
There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution.,0.217,0.846,0.305,0.429,0.221,0.235

There was not a child on board the brig that night who did not already love him.,0.037,0.436,0.716,0.533,0.940,0.508
"He had said horrid things to them and hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with his fist, but they had only clung to him the more.",0.245,0.676,0.738,0.150,0.211,0.522
Michael had tried on his spectacles.,0.552,0.549,0.085,0.594,0.189,0.545

"Hook itched to do it, but it seemed too brutal.",0.694,0.268,0.682,0.713,0.595,0.066
"Instead, he revolved this mystery in his mind: why do they find Smee lovable?",0.488,0.922,0.714,0.792,0.834,0.048
He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was.,0.600,0.190,0.910,0.749,0.983,0.063

A terrible answer suddenly presented itself Good form?,0.708,0.704,0.353,0.944,0.093,0.223
"Had the bo'sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of all?",0.779,0.937,0.225,0.897,0.409,0.779
He remembered that you have to prove you don't know you have it before you are eligible for Pop.,0.302,0.327,0.159,0.501,0.348,0.172
With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee's head; but he did not tear.,0.141,0.279,0.914,0.382,0.738,0.363
What arrested him was this reflection:,0.669,0.049,0.972,0.180,0.989,0.111

Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.,0.931,0.832,0.268,0.539,0.158,0.377

"Tootles hated the idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would be prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer.",0.310,0.784,0.461,0.891,0.802,0.074
"All children know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constant use of it.",0.061,0.631,0.638,0.723,0.326,0.303

No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates.,0.930,0.945,0.016,0.884,0.276,0.181
To the boys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years.,0.825,0.862,0.612,0.286,0.994,0.024
There was not a porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger Dirty pig; and she had already written it on several.,0.040,0.333,0.350,0.941,0.783,0.109
"But as the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of course, save for them.",0.275,0.788,0.843,0.488,0.324,0.176

"With a hasty gesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.",0.314,0.043,0.137,0.679,0.918,0.152

"Silence all, he called gloatingly, for a mother's last words to her children.",0.798,0.136,0.399,0.611,0.284,0.169
At this moment Wendy was grand.,0.095,0.539,0.535,0.280,0.994,0.028
"These are my last words, dear boys, she said firmly.",0.646,0.741,0.596,0.521,0.364,0.107

"John, what are",0.682,0.785,0.441,0.222,0.962,0.166
But Hook had found his voice again.,0.761,0.086,0.062,0.621,0.447,0.635
Tie her up!,0.253,0.397,0.380,0.349,0.078,0.292
It was Smee who tied her to the mast.,0.670,0.056,0.581,0.405,0.911,0.545
"See here, honey, he whispered, I'll save you if you promise to be my mother.",0.554,0.530,0.916,0.659,0.075,0.231
But not even for Smee would she make such a promise.,0.159,0.181,0.908,0.501,0.084,0.156
"I would almost rather have no children at all, she said disdainfully.",0.052,0.086,0.205,0.772,0.996,0.007
It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to the mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were about to take.,0.112,0.214,0.969,0.930,0.990,0.058
"They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.",0.104,0.203,0.527,0.150,0.927,0.054
"Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy.",0.943,0.870,0.918,0.544,0.624,0.426
His intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking the plank one by one.,0.452,0.749,0.983,0.670,0.903,0.129
"But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her.",0.817,0.150,0.145,0.476,0.819,0.247
He heard something else instead.,0.005,0.245,0.556,0.258,0.029,0.342
It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.,0.282,0.267,0.992,0.703,0.750,0.133
"They all heard it pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was blown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but toward Hook.",0.934,0.887,0.352,0.316,0.952,0.257
"All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone, and that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.",0.338,0.306,0.983,0.650,0.982,0.090
Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him.,0.050,0.479,0.832,0.246,0.782,0.457
It was as if he had been clipped at every joint.,0.880,0.393,0.441,0.560,0.992,0.028
He fell in a little heap.,0.197,0.241,0.170,0.432,0.086,0.316

Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic part of what the attacking force wanted.,0.666,0.110,0.990,0.787,0.907,0.239
"Left so fearfully alone, any other man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could go.",0.398,0.243,0.260,0.773,0.818,0.411
"The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.",0.854,0.784,0.851,0.761,0.869,0.069
he cried hoarsely.,0.344,0.217,0.032,0.449,0.012,0.138
"They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming aboard.",0.484,0.131,0.071,0.643,0.962,0.276
They had no thought of fighting it.,0.152,0.116,0.142,0.558,0.793,0.095
It was Fate.,0.934,0.010,0.484,0.681,0.968,0.099
Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boys so that they could rush to the ship's side to see the crocodile climbing it.,0.077,0.059,0.980,0.157,0.814,0.258
Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid.,0.388,0.061,0.987,0.322,0.944,0.036
It was Peter.,0.496,0.032,0.840,0.015,0.963,0.268
He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rouse suspicion.,0.789,0.348,0.485,0.285,0.804,0.064

Now such an experience had come that night to Peter.,0.515,0.344,0.503,0.023,0.207,0.255

"Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested.",0.252,0.290,0.840,0.343,0.566,0.352
"He ticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result.",0.350,0.930,0.833,0.489,0.012,0.123
"The crocodile was among those who heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a fixed idea, it was a stupid beast.",0.743,0.791,0.936,0.497,0.972,0.075

"Some of the miscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys.",0.345,0.281,0.710,0.203,0.981,0.363

"Again and again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space.",0.128,0.338,0.514,0.863,0.547,0.030
"He had lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler, when another, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.",0.781,0.283,0.924,0.660,0.253,0.410
"Put up your swords, boys, cried the newcomer, this man is mine.",0.542,0.844,0.016,0.894,0.809,0.308
Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter.,0.634,0.183,0.868,0.279,0.713,0.721
The others drew back and formed a ring around them.,0.231,0.536,0.786,0.762,0.908,0.643
"For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.",0.428,0.254,0.905,0.457,0.978,0.022
"So, Pan, said Hook at last, this is all your doing.",0.827,0.459,0.208,0.721,0.996,0.008
"Ay, James Hook, came the stern answer, it is all my doing.",0.699,0.484,0.780,0.869,0.106,0.353
"Proud and insolent youth, said Hook, prepare to meet thy doom.",0.015,0.937,0.502,0.098,0.753,0.047
"Dark and sinister man, Peter answered, have at thee.",0.823,0.308,0.557,0.826,0.986,0.032
"Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage to either blade.",0.868,0.234,0.763,0.496,0.915,0.065
"Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe's defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drive the steel home.",0.456,0.377,0.692,0.928,0.331,0.079
"Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again.",0.669,0.207,0.994,0.901,0.986,0.039
"Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely, pierced him in the ribs.",0.783,0.119,0.959,0.477,0.605,0.449
"At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook's hand, and he was at Peter's mercy.",0.719,0.188,0.718,0.758,0.996,0.009
"Now! cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited his opponent to pick up his sword.",0.463,0.660,0.450,0.083,0.387,0.320
"Hook did so instantly, but with a tragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.",0.672,0.143,0.646,0.161,0.926,0.236
"Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicions assailed him now.",0.379,0.511,0.804,0.435,0.967,0.085
"Pan, who and what art thou?",0.491,0.825,0.668,0.217,0.660,0.496
he cried huskily.,0.344,0.217,0.032,0.449,0.012,0.138
"I'm youth, I'm joy, Peter answered at a venture, I'm a little bird that has broken out of the egg.",0.253,0.208,0.253,0.626,0.972,0.036
"This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form.",0.288,0.244,0.924,0.951,0.986,0.203
"To't again, he cried despairingly.",0.461,0.340,0.046,0.626,0.058,0.075
"He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword would have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter fluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone.",0.572,0.559,0.149,0.814,0.224,0.482
And again and again he darted in and pricked.,0.437,0.459,0.155,0.877,0.279,0.142
Hook was fighting now without hope.,0.626,0.090,0.721,0.005,0.966,0.122
That passionate breast no longer asked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was cold forever.,0.132,0.020,0.911,0.672,0.864,0.287
Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.,0.017,0.811,0.279,0.967,0.619,0.205
"In two minutes, he cried, the ship will be blown to pieces.",0.728,0.586,0.056,0.305,0.397,0.089
"Now, now, he thought, true form will show.",0.914,0.844,0.168,0.171,0.656,0.057
"But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands, and calmly flung it overboard.",0.783,0.544,0.529,0.656,0.478,0.421
What sort of form was Hook himself showing?,0.607,0.137,0.982,0.162,0.954,0.170
"Misguided man though he was, we may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was true to the traditions of his race.",0.299,0.873,0.832,0.795,0.741,0.091
"The other boys were flying around him now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.",0.801,0.137,0.855,0.948,0.986,0.045
"And his shoes were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his socks were right.",0.276,0.550,0.936,0.444,0.931,0.023
"James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.",0.620,0.424,0.833,0.777,0.104,0.535
For we have come to his last moment.,0.507,0.947,0.131,0.080,0.008,0.142
"Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea.",0.704,0.563,0.925,0.145,0.125,0.180
He did not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.,0.184,0.344,0.951,0.943,0.995,0.016
"He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him.",0.442,0.872,0.522,0.457,0.248,0.133
"As he stood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot.",0.778,0.253,0.914,0.178,0.871,0.071
It made Peter kick instead of stab.,0.282,0.369,0.090,0.027,0.160,0.397
At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.,0.915,0.435,0.251,0.832,0.993,0.010
"Bad form, he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.",0.502,0.853,0.876,0.047,0.049,0.276
Thus perished James Hook.,0.505,0.043,0.443,0.825,0.202,0.271
"Seventeen, Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his figures.",0.434,0.538,0.913,0.450,0.311,0.250
"Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him nurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and",0.828,0.857,0.877,0.951,0.548,0.215
"Smee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas.",0.094,0.155,0.971,0.848,0.957,0.183
Hook had feared.,0.962,0.197,0.272,0.468,0.867,0.415
"Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominent again.",0.071,0.768,0.686,0.355,0.946,0.124
"She praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one; and then she took them into Hook's cabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail.",0.122,0.555,0.907,0.854,0.598,0.050
It said half-past one!,0.640,0.445,0.393,0.628,0.732,0.238
The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all.,0.774,0.076,0.851,0.684,0.882,0.253
"She got them to bed in the pirates' bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell asleep by the side of Long Tom.",0.241,0.116,0.929,0.852,0.990,0.033
"He had one of his dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.",0.153,0.870,0.706,0.399,0.074,0.103
"By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo'sun, was among them, with a rope's end in his hand and chewing tobacco.",0.199,0.267,0.644,0.964,0.986,0.106
"They all donned pirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.",0.028,0.987,0.432,0.476,0.974,0.032
It need not be said who was the captain.,0.211,0.496,0.367,0.472,0.832,0.275
Nibs and John were first and second mate.,0.450,0.851,0.871,0.325,0.846,0.238
There was a woman aboard.,0.669,0.205,0.531,0.638,0.933,0.304
"The rest were tars before the mast, and lived in the fo'c'sle.",0.842,0.179,0.566,0.551,0.930,0.174
"Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would tear them.",0.720,0.429,0.911,0.895,0.990,0.016
"The bluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily.",0.205,0.232,0.179,0.977,0.677,0.353
"Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed her for the mainland.",0.278,0.027,0.025,0.672,0.928,0.081
"Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship's chart, that if this weather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June, after which it would save time to fly.",0.403,0.303,0.909,0.720,0.560,0.124
"Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour of keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they dared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin.",0.208,0.304,0.003,0.889,0.819,0.246
Instant obedience was the only safe thing.,0.388,0.272,0.960,0.340,0.957,0.138
Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take soundings.,0.253,0.102,0.513,0.771,0.129,0.036
"The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lull Wendy's suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suit was ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of some of Hook's wickedest garments.",0.623,0.587,0.920,0.406,0.973,0.239
"It was afterwards whispered among them that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook's cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger, which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.",0.896,0.929,0.886,0.616,0.838,0.144

It seems a shame to have neglected No.,0.112,0.102,0.267,0.116,0.375,0.209
14 all this time; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us.,0.734,0.734,0.475,0.271,0.971,0.261
"If we had returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, Don't be silly; what do I matter?",0.383,0.779,0.388,0.475,0.983,0.010
Do go back and keep an eye on the children.,0.744,0.459,0.507,0.419,0.979,0.065
So long as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; and they may lay to that.,0.071,0.328,0.262,0.341,0.841,0.120
Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful occupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do not go out for the evening.,0.741,0.792,0.872,0.703,0.923,0.069
We are no more than servants.,0.347,0.988,0.434,0.651,0.513,0.160
"Why on earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry?",0.373,0.095,0.914,0.163,0.116,0.065
Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end in the country?,0.741,0.333,0.717,0.476,0.876,0.149
It would be the moral lesson they have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.,0.794,0.547,0.056,0.230,0.965,0.192
"One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the way authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be here on Thursday week.",0.981,0.856,0.550,0.069,0.953,0.040
This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward.,0.429,0.860,0.916,0.608,0.078,0.113
"They have been planning it out on the ship: mother's rapture, father's shout of joy, Nana's leap through the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared for is a good hiding.",0.724,0.928,0.293,0.929,0.921,0.319
"How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, Dash it all, here are those boys again.",0.932,0.797,0.061,0.198,0.583,0.362
"However, we should get no thanks even for this.",0.829,0.948,0.648,0.753,0.275,0.092

"Yes, but at what a cost!",0.682,0.129,0.610,0.748,0.997,0.016

"Of course, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion's courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought the",0.689,0.440,0.969,0.904,0.918,0.025

"No, my own one, this is the place for me.",0.300,0.675,0.705,0.899,0.186,0.298

"Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave up doing it.",0.127,0.541,0.899,0.270,0.677,0.068

"As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see that his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.",0.536,0.753,0.199,0.786,0.859,0.470
"He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no imagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man.",0.756,0.213,0.929,0.580,0.747,0.256
"Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.",0.467,0.087,0.542,0.880,0.961,0.352
"Listen to them, he said; it is very gratifying.",0.288,0.381,0.967,0.886,0.165,0.269
"Lots of little boys, sneered Liza.",0.515,0.480,0.736,0.027,0.215,0.465
"There were several adults to-day, he assured her with a faint flush; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.",0.481,0.868,0.579,0.838,0.742,0.174
Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter.,0.112,0.975,0.784,0.503,0.225,0.539
"For some time he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling of this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would not be turned by it.",0.174,0.771,0.240,0.802,0.508,0.256
"But if I had been a weak man, he said.",0.534,0.337,0.338,0.175,0.265,0.327
"Good heavens, if I had been a weak man!",0.696,0.478,0.801,0.039,0.519,0.479
"And, George, she said timidly, you are as full of remorse as ever, aren't you?",0.430,0.871,0.008,0.407,0.778,0.328
"Full of remorse as ever, dearest!",0.879,0.281,0.005,0.537,0.199,0.621
See my punishment: living in a kennel.,0.056,0.541,0.027,0.331,0.536,0.382
"But it is punishment, isn't it, George?",0.117,0.440,0.183,0.912,0.270,0.164
You are sure you are not enjoying it?,0.225,0.957,0.432,0.758,0.955,0.087
"You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he curled round in the kennel.",0.029,0.708,0.128,0.475,0.795,0.433
"Won't you play me to sleep, he asked, on the nursery piano?",0.209,0.724,0.069,0.405,0.084,0.148
"and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, And shut that window.",0.183,0.492,0.291,0.615,0.532,0.353
I feel a draught.,0.365,0.373,0.065,0.457,0.095,0.552
"O George, never ask me to do that.",0.416,0.563,0.694,0.075,0.468,0.042
"The window must always be left open for them, always, always.",0.339,0.425,0.309,0.190,0.085,0.615
"Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery and played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John and Michael flew into the room.",0.554,0.659,0.748,0.951,0.767,0.169
"We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement planned by them before we left the ship; but something must have happened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.",0.027,0.731,0.664,0.969,0.594,0.207
Peter's first words tell all.,0.675,0.973,0.908,0.676,0.077,0.373
"Quick Tink, he whispered, close the window; bar it!",0.201,0.114,0.583,0.933,0.267,0.531
Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me.,0.646,0.846,0.412,0.912,0.535,0.114
"Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort the children to the mainland.",0.727,0.852,0.881,0.696,0.771,0.401
This trick had been in his head all the time.,0.581,0.546,0.833,0.236,0.403,0.528
Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then he peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing.,0.615,0.147,0.976,0.263,0.775,0.091
"He whispered to Tink, It's Wendy's mother!",0.843,0.832,0.277,0.940,0.253,0.587
"She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as my mother.",0.144,0.878,0.364,0.785,0.087,0.252
"Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother's was.",0.242,0.127,0.683,0.925,0.929,0.262
Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes bragged about her.,0.314,0.716,0.671,0.911,0.470,0.188
"He did not know the tune, which was Home, Sweet Home, but he knew it was saying, Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy; and he cried exultantly, You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!",0.906,0.743,0.815,0.928,0.725,0.224
"He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw that Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on her eyes.",0.080,0.136,0.979,0.991,0.814,0.298
"She wants me to unbar the window, thought Peter, but I won't, not I!",0.211,0.560,0.375,0.237,0.729,0.380
"He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken their place.",0.123,0.645,0.709,0.979,0.938,0.223
"She's awfully fond of Wendy, he said to himself.",0.410,0.586,0.459,0.150,0.303,0.225
He was angry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.,0.378,0.510,0.800,0.136,0.502,0.023
The reason was so simple: I'm fond of her too.,0.408,0.192,0.885,0.683,0.898,0.242
"We can't both have her, lady.",0.528,0.956,0.060,0.581,0.280,0.334
"But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy.",0.132,0.328,0.466,0.826,0.905,0.164
"He ceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him.",0.232,0.786,0.127,0.645,0.986,0.025
"He skipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him, knocking.",0.101,0.121,0.954,0.234,0.966,0.053
"Oh, all right, he said at last, and gulped.",0.541,0.211,0.096,0.497,0.993,0.008
Then he unbarred the window.,0.083,0.611,0.111,0.198,0.174,0.427
"Come on, Tink, he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of nature; we don't want any silly mothers; and he flew away.",0.341,0.889,0.499,0.970,0.937,0.056
"Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, which of course was more than they deserved.",0.155,0.058,0.459,0.966,0.968,0.269
"They alighted on the floor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten his home.",0.123,0.473,0.899,0.445,0.190,0.178
"John, he said, looking around him doubtfully, I think I have been here before.",0.530,0.445,0.705,0.179,0.036,0.245
"Of course you have, you silly.",0.027,0.418,0.384,0.168,0.270,0.400
There is your old bed.,0.318,0.683,0.168,0.766,0.793,0.176
"So it is, Michael said, but not with much conviction.",0.158,0.491,0.054,0.832,0.081,0.214
"I say, cried John, the kennel!",0.132,0.464,0.080,0.529,0.358,0.710
and he dashed across to look into it.,0.383,0.688,0.892,0.443,0.200,0.251
"Perhaps Nana is inside it, Wendy said.",0.679,0.344,0.038,0.882,0.123,0.432
But John whistled.,0.130,0.467,0.773,0.743,0.404,0.553
"Hullo, he said, there's a man inside it.",0.476,0.670,0.324,0.468,0.071,0.593
It's father! exclaimed Wendy.,0.561,0.689,0.877,0.268,0.140,0.237
"Let me see father, Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.",0.427,0.297,0.924,0.630,0.655,0.495
"He is not so big as the pirate I killed, he said with such frank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been sad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.",0.694,0.227,0.988,0.876,0.421,0.543
Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in the kennel.,0.424,0.934,0.777,0.248,0.994,0.123
"Surely, said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, he used not to sleep in the kennel?",0.160,0.706,0.391,0.447,0.936,0.398
"John, Wendy said falteringly, perhaps we don't remember the old life as well as we thought we did.",0.168,0.984,0.070,0.229,0.802,0.623
A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.,0.139,0.154,0.898,0.113,0.310,0.045
"It is very careless of mother, said that young scoundrel John, not to be here when we come back.",0.245,0.941,0.310,0.527,0.037,0.485
It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.,0.932,0.238,0.912,0.252,0.978,0.100
"cried Wendy, peeping.",0.720,0.778,0.015,0.138,0.028,0.065
So it is! said John.,0.442,0.492,0.214,0.862,0.078,0.406
"Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?",0.638,0.739,0.018,0.640,0.413,0.229
"asked Michael, who was surely sleepy.",0.154,0.009,0.191,0.260,0.606,0.594
"Oh dear! exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse",0.602,0.686,0.011,0.087,0.162,0.227
", it was quite time we came back.",0.626,0.892,0.933,0.143,0.665,0.400
"Let us creep in, John suggested, and put our hands over her eyes.",0.413,0.819,0.068,0.665,0.811,0.442
"But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had a better plan.",0.421,0.498,0.218,0.697,0.406,0.447
"Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as if we had never been away.",0.770,0.979,0.247,0.653,0.820,0.233
"And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husband was asleep, all the beds were occupied.",0.720,0.564,0.953,0.251,0.990,0.098
"The children waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come.",0.125,0.418,0.900,0.913,0.532,0.125
"She saw them, but she did not believe they were there.",0.096,0.754,0.338,0.269,0.988,0.035
"You see, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her still.",0.100,0.527,0.891,0.430,0.872,0.055
"She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had nursed them.",0.365,0.266,0.298,0.102,0.316,0.261
"They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three of them.",0.074,0.468,0.783,0.362,0.190,0.332
"That's Wendy, she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.",0.450,0.383,0.921,0.564,0.987,0.123
"That's John, she said.",0.136,0.216,0.170,0.324,0.170,0.513
Mother! cried Michael.,0.163,0.381,0.005,0.218,0.028,0.359
He knew her now.,0.048,0.878,0.662,0.734,0.248,0.099
"That's Michael, she said, and she stretched out her arms for the three little selfish children they would never envelop again.",0.193,0.395,0.131,0.455,0.310,0.178
"Yes, they did, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed and run to her.",0.661,0.502,0.084,0.523,0.841,0.423
"she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in.",0.145,0.701,0.117,0.362,0.374,0.260
There could not have been a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who was staring in at the window.,0.425,0.079,0.842,0.496,0.994,0.061
He had had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be for ever barred.,0.846,0.255,0.333,0.668,0.993,0.032
I hope you want to know what became of the other boys.,0.364,0.374,0.183,0.037,0.114,0.373
They were waiting below to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted five hundred they went up.,0.103,0.687,0.229,0.563,0.946,0.042
"They went up by the stair, because they thought this would make a better impression.",0.877,0.587,0.632,0.308,0.905,0.084
"They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes.",0.301,0.291,0.243,0.399,0.945,0.095
"They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them.",0.074,0.396,0.252,0.392,0.303,0.300
"They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.",0.040,0.338,0.783,0.410,0.993,0.006
"Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr. Darling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather large number.",0.131,0.217,0.676,0.339,0.985,0.025
"I must say, he said to Wendy, that you don't do things by halves, a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.",0.939,0.444,0.537,0.627,0.997,0.022
"The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, Do you think we should be too much of a handful, sir?",0.070,0.795,0.840,0.609,0.189,0.023
"Because, if so, we can go away.",0.174,0.819,0.259,0.286,0.344,0.396
"Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him.",0.073,0.348,0.878,0.220,0.959,0.186
"He knew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.",0.026,0.509,0.460,0.852,0.451,0.108
"We could lie doubled up, said Nibs.",0.091,0.775,0.463,0.770,0.241,0.489
"I always cut their hair myself, said Wendy.",0.051,0.296,0.187,0.200,0.128,0.604
"Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing himself in such an unfavourable light.",0.658,0.247,0.930,0.135,0.727,0.446
"Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out.",0.868,0.512,0.242,0.932,0.172,0.322
"He was as glad to have them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his consent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his own house.",0.174,0.334,0.855,0.809,0.687,0.243
"I don't think he is a cypher, Tootles cried instantly.",0.026,0.273,0.479,0.904,0.090,0.121
"Do you think he is a cypher, Curly?",0.394,0.861,0.649,0.865,0.784,0.020
"No, I don't.",0.301,0.418,0.001,0.631,0.009,0.322
"Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?",0.631,0.851,0.847,0.878,0.640,0.033
"Twin, what do you think?",0.561,0.086,0.351,0.339,0.772,0.011
"It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was absurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room if they fitted in.",0.326,0.110,0.876,0.980,0.762,0.212
"We'll fit in, sir, they assured him.",0.085,0.148,0.912,0.983,0.842,0.116
"Then follow the leader, he cried gaily.",0.713,0.484,0.099,0.164,0.234,0.279
"Mind you, I am not sure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same.",0.578,0.983,0.333,0.844,0.320,0.177
"He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried Hoop la! and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget whether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted in.",0.375,0.006,0.714,0.983,0.991,0.099
"As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away.",0.141,0.142,0.316,0.388,0.085,0.208
"He did not exactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could open it if she liked and call to him.",0.233,0.614,0.908,0.664,0.542,0.125
That is what she did.,0.534,0.539,0.607,0.779,0.959,0.225
"Hullo, Wendy, good-bye, he said.",0.836,0.842,0.049,0.532,0.104,0.349
"Oh dear, are you going away?",0.462,0.531,0.268,0.085,0.902,0.051
"You don't feel, Peter, she said falteringly, that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?",0.280,0.269,0.823,0.489,0.830,0.235
"About me, Peter?",0.767,0.057,0.506,0.034,0.105,0.292
"Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp eye on Wendy.",0.649,0.423,0.324,0.381,0.993,0.030
"She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys, and would like to adopt him also.",0.330,0.446,0.831,0.161,0.822,0.248
Would you send me to school?,0.166,0.609,0.138,0.283,0.063,0.263
he inquired craftily.,0.056,0.266,0.020,0.186,0.002,0.128
And then to an office?,0.936,0.635,0.444,0.537,0.553,0.227
I suppose so.,0.528,0.839,0.337,0.451,0.019,0.149
Soon I would be a man?,0.279,0.571,0.617,0.490,0.181,0.473
"I don't want to go to school and learn solemn things, he told her passionately.",0.537,0.546,0.603,0.690,0.218,0.456
I don't want to be a man.,0.448,0.335,0.213,0.738,0.042,0.706
"O Wendy's mother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!",0.219,0.215,0.991,0.934,0.968,0.493
"Peter, said Wendy the comforter, I should love you in a beard; and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.",0.722,0.477,0.261,0.928,0.405,0.463
"Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.",0.159,0.580,0.860,0.928,0.407,0.189
But where are you going to live?,0.277,0.733,0.184,0.200,0.809,0.135
With Tink in the house we built for Wendy.,0.532,0.931,0.302,0.806,0.173,0.104
The fairies are to put it high up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.,0.518,0.873,0.849,0.956,0.985,0.006
"How lovely, cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her grip.",0.726,0.492,0.723,0.041,0.341,0.644
"I thought all the fairies were dead, Mrs. Darling said.",0.369,0.521,0.763,0.557,0.977,0.349
"There are always a lot of young ones, explained Wendy, who was now quite an authority, because you see when a new baby laughs for the first time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there are always new fairies.",0.828,0.362,0.672,0.913,0.945,0.205
"They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just little sillies who are not sure what they are.",0.474,0.791,0.666,0.750,0.963,0.120

"Tink can't go a twentieth part of the way round, she reminded him a little tartly.",0.102,0.651,0.876,0.885,0.406,0.413
Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.,0.722,0.736,0.884,0.892,0.076,0.497
"It doesn't matter, Peter said.",0.546,0.236,0.324,0.281,0.686,0.228

"Oh, all right, Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness merely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning.",0.916,0.827,0.202,0.368,0.386,0.124
Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gay again.,0.211,0.498,0.665,0.881,0.590,0.140
"He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them.",0.715,0.433,0.825,0.917,0.665,0.061
I suppose it was because Wendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:,0.336,0.806,0.574,0.568,0.951,0.081
"You won't forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time comes?",0.976,0.126,0.500,0.254,0.411,0.222
Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away.,0.661,0.156,0.272,0.565,0.469,0.297
He took Mrs. Darling's kiss with him.,0.140,0.436,0.661,0.148,0.617,0.420
"The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily.",0.232,0.108,0.936,0.020,0.640,0.293

"At first Nana tied their feet to the bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of their diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they let",0.625,0.054,0.090,0.981,0.986,0.037

Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her.,0.109,0.129,0.835,0.648,0.777,0.109
"But he was exactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little house on the tree tops.",0.347,0.103,0.985,0.805,0.646,0.277
Next year he did not come for her.,0.150,0.533,0.890,0.581,0.223,0.354

Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never knew he had missed a year.,0.406,0.396,0.851,0.384,0.672,0.351
That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him.,0.507,0.551,0.354,0.110,0.891,0.269

She was as grown up as that.,0.366,0.193,0.597,0.265,0.854,0.245
What did his crow sound like?,0.493,0.310,0.929,0.580,0.984,0.333
Jane asked one evening.,0.135,0.400,0.975,0.831,0.205,0.198

Wendy was a little startled.,0.610,0.471,0.688,0.510,0.829,0.574
