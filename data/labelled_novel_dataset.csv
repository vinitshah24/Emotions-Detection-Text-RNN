I complain of so-and-so,sadness
"'Silence,' cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them that they were not all to speak at once.",anger
"He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he was the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.",thankfulness

"'It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?' Wendy said, frightfully gratified.",thankfulness
"Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a mother’s love.",joy
"Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear.",fear
"Now these three children had a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and chained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.",sadness
'Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents with all their children flown away.',sadness
"They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.",anger
"This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and she said to him rather sharply, 'Peter, will you make the necessary arrangements?'",thankfulness
"'It will be worse than before she came,' they cried.",sadness
"'Who are you? How dare you? Go away,' she cried.",anger
"'She says she won’t!' Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’s chamber.",anger
I am going to give you your medicine before you go,thankfulness
"No, no,' he told Wendy decisively",anger
"'If the redskins have won,' he said, 'they will beat the tom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.'",joy
"'It’s awfully sad,' the first twin said cheerfully.",sadness
"'O Wendy, who is she?' cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn’t know.",joy
"They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; and with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.",anger
"Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child when he should give in.",fear
"'At once,' Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come to her: 'Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.'",sadness
"'Tootles,' she cried, 'I appeal to you.'",sadness
"'Thank you, Peter.'",thankfulness
"'Tink,' he rapped out, 'if you don’t get up and dress at once I will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your negligée.'",anger
"'All right,' Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they rushed to get their things.",joy
"'No,' he answered, pretending indifference, 'I am not going with you, Wendy.'",sadness
"Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him",sadness
"'What is it?' she asked, anxious about him at once.",thankfulness
'Do you mean we shall both be drowned?',fear
"'It lifted Michael off the ground,' he cried; 'why should it not carry you?'",sadness
Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark: 'Shut up!',anger
"Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite.",love
"She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, both cheering.",joy
"'You dunderheaded little jay!' she screamed, 'Why don’t you do as I tell you?'",anger
The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.,anger
"Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.",thankfulness
'I complain of so-and-so;' but what usually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.,sadness
"This was grumbling. 'We complain of John,' cried the twins.",sadness
"'Dance away, my little man,' said Peter, who was in high good humour.",joy
"'I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,' said Tootles.",joy
"'It’s an awfully good story,' said Nibs.",love
"There was not a sound, and he drew himself up firmly to his full height.",fear
"Bill Jukes dead",sadness
"Go back and fetch me out that doodle-doo",anger
"Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him",sadness
"If they kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them, we’re none the worse",fear
"To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin; and they were panic-stricken",fear
"O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back",joy
"The children waited for her cry of joy, but it did not come",sadness
"George, George! she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in.",fear
"He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried Hoop la! and danced after him",joy
"that you would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject",love
"I should love you in a beard",love
"It will be rather lonely in the evening, she said, sitting by the fire.",sadness
"He took Mrs. Darling’s kiss with him",love
"Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying.",sadness
"Wendy would have cried if Michael had not been crying.",fear
"he wants me always to do his spring cleaning.",sadness
