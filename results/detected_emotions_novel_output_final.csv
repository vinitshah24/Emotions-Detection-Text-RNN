I suppose she must have looked rather delightful,0.049,0.891,0.514,0.563,0.823,0.022
Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried,0.598,0.601,0.214,0.338,0.531,0.404
"She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth.",0.888,0.169,0.770,0.536,0.866,0.209
"Her romantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the puzzling East",0.410,0.341,0.418,0.646,0.737,0.114
"her sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.",0.309,0.797,0.939,0.860,0.712,0.250
the many gentlemen who had been boys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,0.444,0.462,0.849,0.563,0.900,0.139
"Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a passion, slamming the door",0.405,0.956,0.337,0.687,0.870,0.117
Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him but respected him.,0.144,0.715,0.632,0.108,0.580,0.124
he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any woman respect him.,0.048,0.268,0.406,0.315,0.950,0.114
For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be able to keep her,0.929,0.343,0.610,0.436,0.961,0.083
as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was frightfully proud of her,0.446,0.061,0.785,0.216,0.668,0.032
"but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs. Darlings bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while she looked at him imploringly.",0.341,0.814,0.688,0.905,0.995,0.013
"Of course we can, George, she cried",0.277,0.792,0.088,0.318,0.583,0.156
"Remember mumps, he warned her almost threateningly",0.928,0.956,0.363,0.697,0.157,0.292
There was the same excitement over John,0.146,0.357,0.836,0.305,0.938,0.259
Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so,0.572,0.523,0.348,0.441,0.521,0.262
and was much hated by careless nursemaids,0.012,0.185,0.587,0.294,0.968,0.086
up at any moment of the night if one of her charges made the slightest cry,0.311,0.689,0.733,0.131,0.982,0.017
"I know she admires you tremendously, George",0.162,0.440,0.329,0.441,0.247,0.300
"Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to be specially nice to father",0.518,0.354,0.963,0.101,0.758,0.245
"Lovely dances followed, in which the only other servant",0.557,0.843,0.495,0.082,0.485,0.575
"And gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her was the kiss",0.074,0.199,0.886,0.367,0.922,0.467
There never was a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.,0.447,0.191,0.630,0.012,0.982,0.142
"When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions",0.957,0.368,0.963,0.434,0.387,0.329
"John had no friends, Michael had friends at night",0.399,0.514,0.053,0.348,0.990,0.011
"Yes, he is rather cocky",0.161,0.791,0.268,0.839,0.717,0.551
"There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the way with them",0.518,0.731,0.510,0.159,0.822,0.113
But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quite a shock.,0.669,0.329,0.556,0.177,0.446,0.324
It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,0.597,0.777,0.943,0.610,0.046,0.404
"What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without knocking",0.309,0.531,0.896,0.289,0.761,0.021
"My child, the mother cried, why did you not tell me of this before?",0.462,0.361,0.752,0.478,0.585,0.283
All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat down tranquilly by the fire to sew,0.579,0.826,0.580,0.152,0.991,0.020
"Mrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened, and Nana entered, returned from her evening out.",0.485,0.168,0.818,0.260,0.576,0.430
"She growled and sprang at the boy, who leapt lightly through the window.",0.346,0.714,0.378,0.412,0.991,0.077
"Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed",0.858,0.578,0.352,0.123,0.917,0.068
But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window,0.169,0.415,0.600,0.491,0.994,0.029
That fiend! Mr. Darling would cry,0.575,0.234,0.769,0.129,0.970,0.067
Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.,0.032,0.788,0.065,0.763,0.096,0.053
"I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother",0.606,0.822,0.693,0.208,0.863,0.287
"Michael had nearly cried. Nobody wants me, he said, and of course the lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.",0.690,0.129,0.675,0.455,0.394,0.236
Then he had leapt into her arms.,0.779,0.531,0.371,0.239,0.041,0.308
Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!,0.452,0.500,0.025,0.652,0.295,0.412
"I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck we dont go out to dinner to-night, and if I dont go out to dinner to-night",0.044,0.966,0.154,0.908,0.806,0.120
Wont; wont! Michael cried naughtily,0.626,0.323,0.015,0.428,0.130,0.270
"I know where it is, father, Wendy cried, always glad to be of service.",0.173,0.016,0.459,0.723,0.133,0.495
"I shall be sick, you know, Mr. Darling said threateningly.",0.723,0.734,0.357,0.254,0.664,0.127
"The point is, that there is more in my glass than in Michaels spoon. His proud heart was nearly bursting.",0.642,0.193,0.373,0.925,0.521,0.036
"Thats right, he shouted. Coddle her! Nobody coddles me.",0.022,0.127,0.314,0.851,0.336,0.070
that is her bark when she smells danger.,0.126,0.829,0.919,0.834,0.411,0.302
Shut up!.,0.678,0.233,0.101,0.373,0.072,0.383
Then at last he understood and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to the bird as she fluttered overhead.,0.330,0.798,0.904,0.364,0.983,0.033
Well it very soon discovered that she had come to the island and it found her out and they just ran into each other’s arms.,0.085,0.577,0.255,0.345,0.060,0.242
What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only as people he had once known while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.,0.467,0.374,0.940,0.875,0.995,0.033
These things scared her a little.,0.652,0.426,0.223,0.720,0.049,0.501
It was a sanguinary affair and especially interesting as showing one of Peter’s peculiarities which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides.,0.137,0.118,0.990,0.852,0.900,0.299
he called out I’m redskin to-day; what are you Tootles? And Tootles answered Redskin; what are you Nibs? and Nibs said Redskin; what are you Twin? and so on.,0.710,0.959,0.922,0.947,0.972,0.091
That is a pretty story and the end shows how grateful a bird can be.,0.552,0.395,0.677,0.688,0.896,0.359
A shorter adventure and quite as exciting was Tinker Bell’s attempt with the help of some street fairies to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland.,0.447,0.875,0.842,0.959,0.438,0.488
Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees not one of them dared to accept his challenge.,0.941,0.757,0.356,0.152,0.026,0.392
The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon when they utter strange wailing cries.,0.512,0.176,0.463,0.955,0.997,0.009
The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails.,0.526,0.582,0.435,0.151,0.723,0.354
Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time and it is quite a pretty sight.,0.061,0.263,0.988,0.781,0.982,0.050
Peter sprang erect as wide awake at once as a dog and with one warning cry he roused the others.,0.081,0.300,0.812,0.825,0.968,0.015
He stood motionless one hand to his ear.,0.511,0.742,0.310,0.688,0.052,0.390
Luff you lubber cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s.,0.386,0.410,0.486,0.649,0.929,0.325
Wendy was crying for it was the first tragedy she had seen.,0.200,0.257,0.841,0.658,0.912,0.089
The captain! said the pirates staring at each other in surprise.,0.896,0.752,0.065,0.608,0.989,0.022
Set her free came the astonishing answer.,0.781,0.352,0.649,0.277,0.512,0.134
Better do what the captain orders said Starkey nervously.,0.866,0.082,0.499,0.297,0.752,0.084
Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness,0.218,0.459,0.349,0.266,0.821,0.296
"Peter may have been about to crow but his face puckered in a whistle of surprise instead.,surprise
There was a break in his voice as if for a moment he recalled innocent days when—but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.""",0.742,0.346,0.495,0.893,0.734,0.196
Hook winced. Ay he said that is the fear that haunts me.,0.903,0.769,0.435,0.414,0.052,0.452
Hook raised his voice but there was a quiver in it.,0.278,0.161,0.603,0.465,0.969,0.323
His face had gone black with rage but he saw that they believed their words and he was startled.,0.721,0.324,0.722,0.621,0.957,0.082
Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night he cried dost hear me?,0.101,0.498,0.404,0.525,0.189,0.218
Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter.,0.571,0.296,0.848,0.044,0.886,0.352
He could only stare horrified.,0.197,0.067,0.904,0.310,0.056,0.170
no elation on the pestilent face now only white fear for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him.,0.045,0.520,0.986,0.057,0.963,0.163
On ordinary occasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering.,0.740,0.924,0.091,0.353,0.374,0.228
Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last.,0.471,0.036,0.791,0.232,0.997,0.011
Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him.,0.157,0.703,0.595,0.097,0.433,0.266
It was saying To die will be an awfully big adventure.,0.463,0.286,0.907,0.149,0.972,0.489
I can suppose only that like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them she was melted because he had all his first teeth.,0.772,0.436,0.534,0.775,0.928,0.804
The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.,0.553,0.119,0.778,0.070,0.580,0.227
You dunderheaded little jay! she screamed Why don’t you do as I tell you?.,0.319,0.730,0.045,0.388,0.068,0.020
it was not even to watch him get into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.,0.616,0.360,0.993,0.084,0.975,0.064
The Never bird saw at once what he was up to and screamed her admiration of him; and alas Peter crowed his agreement with her.,0.630,0.092,0.553,0.121,0.994,0.018
She drifted in one direction and he was borne off in another both cheering.,0.362,0.503,0.267,0.568,0.953,0.133
Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almost as soon as Wendy who had been carried hither and thither by the kite.,0.733,0.358,0.671,0.866,0.852,0.306
Smee reflected. I can’t think of a thing he said regretfully.,0.543,0.854,0.405,0.715,0.660,0.020
Shut up!.,0.678,0.233,0.101,0.373,0.072,0.383
